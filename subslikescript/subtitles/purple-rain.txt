Ladies and gentlemen: The Revolution!
[SONG: Let's Go Crazy - Prince and the Revolution]
Dearly beloved
We r gathered here today
to get through this thing called life
Electric word life
that means forever
and that's a mighty long time.
But I'm here to tell you
There's something else.
The after world
A World of never ending happiness.
You can always see the sun.
Day or night.
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills...
You know the one.
'Dr. Everything'll Be Alright'
Instead of asking him
how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, Baby.
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder
than in the after world.
In this life...
You're on your own.
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down...
Go Crazy.
Punch a higher floor.
Woo!

Here. Fill this out.
I'll have him call you later.
I don't have a phone.
When will he be back?
Well, you can try tomorrow.
Thanks.
"Apollonia"?
Why don't you stay awhile?
See how it's done.
So sexy!
Ladies and gentlemen:
Please welcome The Time.
I really liked your song, too.
Listen to me!
You come home when I say come home.
You got no business in the streets.
Leave me alone.
Come here!
I said, "Now!"
- Do you hear me?
-Mom! Dad!
Keep this place clean!
Please, Dad, she's heard you!
He wants to kill me.
He's crazy.
Look what he's doing to me.
I don't get it.
An important meeting like this
and he doesn't show up.
The Kid must've forgotten
who owns this club.
I got to make some changes. Fast.
It's going to affect all the bands.
It's the second time he's missed.
I'm telling you he's fucking up.
You know what you need to do?
You need to get rid of him.
The last three bands that came out here
went on to be big stars.
I thought The Kid was next, but he's
ruined it. He ain't even pulling them in.
He just plays a lot of shit
that nobody wants to hear.
Like his old man, Francis L.
Did he ever mess his career up!
Ruined his wife's, too.
Now The Kid's doing the same shit.
I hear he's having a problem with
his band...especially Lisa and Wendy.
They won't be together for long.
I'm telling you, you need to get rid of him.
I need to get somebody commercial.
Something that will work every night.
Like a girls' group?
Yeah, a girls' group. Yeah, Morris.
Something sexy, but not dirty.
I got enough problems.
I'll lay it on you straight.
I put together something hot...
...and The Kid is out, right?
It's kind of dead in here.
Where is everybody?
I don't know. Billy and Morris
were sure looking for you.
That's nice.
Maybe I'll come back at a better time.
Think tonight this place-'ll be jumping?
Well, I'll be here.
Wait!
I've got something for you.
What? A subpoena?
A song Lisa and Wendy wrote.
Why didn't they give it to me themselves?
I liked it and wanted to listen to it.
They told me to give it to you
when I was done.
You really liked it?
Oh, Lord! Cut!
You ladies don't seem to realize
how valuable my time is.
You're going to make my boys look bad.
Let us come up with our own steps.
We tried that. Remember?
You're in the best possible position
you could be in.
So, what's the matter?
Your shoes on too tight?
Let's have some action!
Let's have some asses wiggling.
I want some perfection.
I think I'm going to need a drink.
This ain't happening.
The bitches are okay, but...
...we need something more exciting.
We should be doing better. Any ideas"!
That Apollonia babe we saw last night.
Why don't we find out where she lives?
I already got that.
Jill gave me everything last night.
What are we waiting for? Let's go!
No, I want her to come to me.
I'm the only star in town.
Morris, who do you think you are?
I waited up all night for you!
I'm tired of you doing this to me!
Who the fuck do you think I am?
Let go of me, you thick-headed creep!
Such nastiness.
Let's go.
Give me that.
That. On your boot.
Hey. wait!
Give it back to me!
You can have it later.
I want it back now.
Who gave it to you?
A person.
Male or female?
You're lying. I can tell just
by your reaction, you're lying.
So, you gave it to me.
It's not yours anymore.
Do you see something you like?
Let's go.
Where do you come from?
New Orleans.
What are you doing here?
I heard about the club
and I thought I'd try my luck.
You're in the business?
I'm a singer.
First Avenue is really famous.
A lot of bands make it after playing there.
It must be really exciting.
Is that what turns you on?
What do you mean?
Making it.
It'd be nice for a change.
It's all I dream about.
And you]
What do you dream about?
Will you help me?
No.
Pardon me?
No.
Want to know why"!
No.
'Cause you wouldn't pass the initiation.
What initiation?
For starters...
...you have to purify yourself
in the waters of Lake Minnetonka.
What?
You have to purify yourself
in Lake Minnetonka.
Wait! That's...
Hold it.
What?
That ain't Lake Minnetonka.
I don't believe it!
How could you do that to me?
Damn you! I'll kill you!
Are you sick?
How many girls have you done this to?
Come on. Let's go.
I'm not going anywhere.
That was a rotten thing to do.
I'm sorry.
I tried to stop you.
I must have looked ridiculous.
No, you looked great.
That took some nerve.
I wouldn't have gotten in that water.
Come on.
Don't get my seat all wet.
The girl has expensive taste,
but can she sing?
As fine as she is, she doesn't have
to know how to sing.
Hey! Watch it, man!
Stay out of the set tonight.
I want you to work the floor.
What for?
I want to know when that sweet thing
shows up. You see her, come get me.
Cool. I come get you,
let you know the girl's there.
Not if I'm with my other babes.
That wouldn't be cool.
I don't want to break their hearts.
So, we ought to have like a signal.
A password.
- O kay, what's the password?
-You got it.
- G ot what?
-The password.
- The password is what?
-Exactly.
- The password is "exactly"?
-No.
Hold it, hold it. Slow down.
- The babe walks in. You see her.
-I see her.
- You come get me.
-I come get you.
I'll have some sexies on standby,
so you glide by me and you saymwhat?
Okay.
- The password is "okay"?
-As far as I'm concerned.
- Say the password!
-What?
Say the password!
The password is "what."
- That's what I'm asking you.
-it's the password.
- The password is "it"?
-The password is "what."
"it." You just said so!
- The password isn't "it," it's--
-What?
- Got it.
-I got it?
- Right!
-"it" or "right"?
What?
Hi.
I heard through the grapevine
that you had a new tune written by...
...a couple of great girls.
Did you hear it?
I knew it. He didn't listen to it.
He probably dropped it under his bike
and rolled over it.
Wow. All right.
You think about this.
I'll be honest with you.
I think you're being full of shit.
Forget it, Wendy.
Let's get out of here.
Every time we give you a song,
you say you'll use it, but you don't.
You think we're going behind your back.
You're being paranoid as usual.
Shut up, Lisa! Please.
You should know by now
that we wouldn't hurt you.
You should know by now
that we wouldn't put...
...a dark cloud over your head.
It's just to make you feel good.
You've felt this way
with us before, remember?
"The nominees for best actress are..."
Fuck it, Wendy. Let's break.
Why should he do your music?
He's been doing fine without it.
Next thing you know,
you'll want to use his motorcycle.
You can really hurt people.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Doesn't that make you feel like shit?
Come on.
I'm so tired of this.
You tired, too?
God got Wendy's periods reversed.
About every 28 days,
she starts acting nice.
Lasts about a weekend.
What difference does it make?
We're still a group, right?
So, what was that you were saying
about timing?
I like that. So cute.
Makes you look young.
"What."
- What?
-Right. "What."
- What?
-You got it.
I sot it"!
You don't need those girls
or their stupid music.
All you need is me.
I don't know.
Life's a bitch.
Five minutes.
Apollonia, I'd like you
to meet Morris E. Day.
- The pleasure is all mine.
-Please excuse me.
Too sexy?
Have the waitress bring a bottle
of their best champagne.
Your lips would make a lollipop too happy.
You think so?
Yes.
Who's paying for this?
I think you know that.
Jerome.
Keep the change.
Get my change.
Of course. Anything.
Would you require anything else
besides my company to make you happy?
Either there's something in my drink...
...or you're the finest woman
I've seen in ages.
What did you say?
You look nice tonight.
I wish you could see my home.
It's so exciting.
In my bedroom...
...I have a brass...
...waterbed.
I have an Italian cook.
Gino Sesacagrattchi,
or something like that.
It's rare that I put my cards
on the table with young ladies, but...
...I'm going to make you love me.
Ladies and gentlemen:
Please welcome The Revolution.

- Man, that was great.
-Pick one song and split.
Can't do it any better than that.
Did you see Morris's face?
Of course I did.
What's this one-song shit?
Billy, don't worry about it.
Hey, I'm warning you!
We'll have to go to your place.
What for?
I want to show you something.
No, we can't.
Why, is somebody there?
Why do you always think
there's somebody else?
Let's go.
Yeah, but we're not going to my place.
Are those your folks?
Yeah.
Freak show.
If you think you scared me, you didn't.
So who's the lucky girl?
Sounds like she's having a good time.
She's crying. It's backwards.
Makes me sad when I hear it.
Sounds like she's laughing, doesn't it?
So what did you do to her?
Do you always treat your women like that?
I don't have anybody right now.
King Kong?
Stop.
- See you later?
-When?
Why?
- I have something to do first.
-What?
It's a secret.
Will you come see me tonight?
About 8:00?
What's the matter?
You like that"! Is that better?
Where is everybody?
You're late. They left.
What are you doing here?
"But I'm here to tell you,
there's something else."
Our music.
Can't you guys get off it?
Can't you just leave it alone?
I told you already. I'm not going
to do your stupid music. Get off it!
Yeah, we'll get off it.
Good morning!
What are you doing here?
I think I have something
you might be interested in.
Yeah? What?
A little song and dance.
That is, if you can sing and dance.
The Kid's going to help me.
No, he isn't.
He's never done anything in his whole life
for anybody but himself.
That's not true.
Yes, it is. What's he done for you?
I've got things to do.
What you gonna do?
Wait!
Okay, straight up.
I have a little group
and you'd fit in real well.
Just come by. Maybe we can
work something out.
Just business?
You can make up your own mind.
Just come by.
I know you could use the break.
Don't you want to be a star? I do.
This just might work out for both of us.
Know any good pawnshops?
Sure. Why?
I'm thinking about buying a guitar.
You do what I' say! Do you hear me?
You do what I' say!
You keep this place clean!
You belong here and no place else!
You have no business leaving!
You're always sneaking around!
You're a sinner!
Shut up! You don't care about me.
Don't I keep the heat on?
I don't like it here!
You never talk to me.
Dad, please!
What's the matter with this house?
You're crazy!
Shut up!
I'm just trapped here.
You'll always have a roof overhead.
You don't let me have any fun.
I could make you happy...
...if you just believed in me.
If you just believed in me.
You never...
I would die for you.
- What is it?
-Open it.
How'd you do it?
You like it?
Thank you.
I'm going to join Morris's group.
What?
I'm going to join Morris's group.
Just leave me alone.
I don't want you around this at all.
I don't want you in my life this way.
Don't I make you happy?
Don't you like the way we are"!
I want to do it. You should trust me.
Do you know Morris?
Do you know what he is about?
He doesn't care about you.
Are you jealous?
Where are Lisa and Wendy?
They haven't shown up yet.
They call?
The boss wants to see you.
Tell him I'm rehearsing.
Now.
You having some problems?
No.
No? Where are Lisa and Wendy?
Hey, that's cool.
Morris says he's got a new group
called Apollonia Six.
You know anything about them?
Tells me they're real hot.
He says, "Billy, you're gonna like
these girls."
Got one problem, though.
What's that?
I got three acts. I don't need four.
That means one of you has got to go.
What would you do in my position?

Where are you?
Where are you?
Answer me, motherfucker!
Is that yours?
Of course it's mine.
Whose else would it be?
I got lots of them.
They're all different, too.
I'd like to see them.
You got them written down?
No, man.
I don't write them down.
I don't have to.
That's the difference between you and me.
I thought you weren't going
to play anymore.
I saw Morn up the street.
She looked pretty bad.
How did she get that way?
You got a girlfriend?
Yeah, I got a girlfriend.
Are you going to get married?
I don't know.
Never get married.
"Is the water boiling?
"Shall we begin?"
What are we doing here?
What do you mean?
I don't want to be here.
I don't want to hurt anybody.
It's not about hurting anybody.
We open at The Taste tomorrow.
This is business. We need the exposure.
Anyway, you don't want
to disappoint them, do you?
Your horns are showing.
It's a little empty tonight.
Of course, money isn't everything.
The Kid is in rare form tonight.
What's wrong with you, Kid?
I don't have time for your bullshit!
What do you want?
I told you before. This stage is no place
for your personal shit!
- That's life.
-Life, my ass, motherfucker!
This is a business,
you ain't too far gone to see that yet.
I told you before, you're not packing
them in like you used to.
Nobody digs your music but yourself.
Fuck off!
Just like your old man.
You got it. Tell me I'm wrong.
You're not blind.
Look around. No one's digging you.
Buddy! What a fucking waste!
But, like father, like son.
Lay off that!
Let me give you some good advice.
Your music makes sense to no one...
...but yourself.
That was fucked up what you did.
Morris and I don't like it.
I don't care.
It's obvious you don't have what it takes
to be on top.
But to show you we're sympathetic
to your problems...
...here's some tickets for tomorrow's show.
Enjoy it.
Don't forget to bring a girlfriend.
Now, without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen, Apollonia Six!
Morris is squeezing you, Kiddo.
Kick ass tomorrow night, or else!
Did you hear those people applauding?
They loved us!
We're all gonna be big stars.
I can feel it!
"Ain't nobody bad like me."
Morris, you're a genius.
Let's go, baby.
Where's Jerome?
In his skin!
Is he gonna come?
I gave him the night off.
Why?
Ain't this a bitch!
I just had my coat cleaned!
Four-hundred-dollar cashmere!
Get on!
Come on!
Stop!
Motherfucker!
You long-haired faggot!
Why are you doing that?
Don't tell me what to do.
Don't drink that. Give it to me.
Go ahead. Go on.
Get up the stairs and don't let anybody in.
Come here!
Do you hear me?
Ladies and gentlemen:
Please welcome The Time.
I don't want to see you no more.
Gentlemen, are we ready?
We're gonna do this number!
What time is it?
You got ten seconds
to get to the dance floor.
Last call for alcohol!
If you ain't guzzling,
get the hell out of here!
Thank you.
The Revolution who? Fuck them!
They might as well go home.
What's happening?
You ain't even sweating.
You ain't even sweating.
"Let's get crazy!"
"Let's get nuts!"
How's the family?
Let's go.
Yeah, let's get them.
Ladies and gentlemen: The Revolution!
I'd like to dedicate this to my father.
It's a song the girls in the band wrote,
Lisa and Wendy.
