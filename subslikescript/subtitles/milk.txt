What's up Cevdet?
Let's ride around.
You go ahead.
I'm going to go home.
Jump in!
Want some?
No, thanks.
OK but what's it to you?
I'm coming.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
He doesn't hear me now,
he's not aside.
They stayed in the car.
Just like I said...
I don't know what happens when...
I don't know...
The bike's tire
keeps going down Yusuf.
You need to take it
to the repairman.
OK. Mom.
I'll take care of it.
You always say
you'll take care of it...
I'm going to end up
stuck on the road.
Welcome!
- How much is fresh cheese?
- 5 Liras.
And the other, 10 Liras.
We have herb cheese too
And some s?zme. Like some?
- How much is that?
- 15 liras.
- And for the blacks?
- The one with a buckle? 40 liras.
Where have you been?
I was just looking around.
- What's that?
- A new knife.
Don't we already have one?
The one we use is all rusty.
If it does the job, it's good enough!
Yusuf!
What's the way
to Hunchback Musa's house?
Off that way.
Sir, I gave you a file.
Have you read it?
Really?
A file of some of my poems.
Your clothes, books,
pens, magazines...
Nothing left!
How am I going to keep
this house running?
You get up in the morning
with a book in your hand.
You get out, you look at the sky,
look at the ground...
At a flower or a bug...
Anything came for me?
Nope.
I said there's nothing for you.
I would bring it to you.
Stop bothering me everyday.
- You are sure that nothing has come then?
- Nothing.
Son, get me another beer!
Teacher, I sent my poems
to thatjournal you mentioned.
Two beers!
- Which journal did you send them to?
- D??ler.
Excuse me.
Little girl!
Excuse me.
- Do you know who owns that bicycle?
- Yes, my father.
Does he have a tire pump?
Dad!
Let me go and get him.
My cycle's tire's flat.
Have you got a tire pump?
Should have.
Let me go and get it.
- That's good enough!
- No, it's not.
It's got a bad valve.
- Bye Dad!
- Bye Dear!
Do you live far from here?
A bit out of town.
Yusuf...
I'm going to knock him over the head
with that typewriter!
You still didn't go
to the repair shop!
The cycle's tire
went flat again today.
Yusuf!
Hurry up and come here!
There's a snake!
Where did it go?
Under the counter.
- Was it big?
- Huge!
Quit exaggerating!
There are no huge snakes around here.
Be careful.
Those things can be poisonous.
What color was it?
How am I to know? Maybe gray.
Get Kemal and come back...
He's sleeping at this hour.
You're right.
Don't stay there!
Bring him tomorrow morning.
Shut the door.
Stuff a towel or something under it.
Don'tjust hang around there!
Go to bed, I'll take care of it.
Do you hear it?
What?
The sound of water.
Yusuf G?ner?
That's us.
Have a good day!
Don't touch it,
I'll take it to the market.
What did you cook?
Green beans.
Come sit down.
What are you smiling about?
Come on... Why the smile...
Who's the girl?
Which one?
How many are there, son?
There is no girl...
No girlfriend?
No.
Mom, where do you come up with that?
Yeah, yeah...
I know there is.
Do you like her a lot?
Who?
Zeyno!
Who is this Zeyno?
Melahat's daughter, Zeyno.
She's still a kid.
But the girl you described
is just like her.
And where did I do that?
Her hair, her eyes,
her eyebrows...
Where?
Where did you write that?
I don't know!
Well then what is this?
They published my poem
and you say that's about Zeyno!
I'm leaving guys.
See you later.
Good luck son!
Who is it?
Milkman!
I've got fresh milk.
Would you like some?
It's fresh milk.
- Will you bring everyday?
- Of course.
How much?
75 Kurus.
- Let me get your money.
- Thanks.
Here you go.
Have a nice day!
Excuse me?
Could I get some too?
I'm coming!
Welcome.
- How are you doing?
- What can I say. Working.
Every week.
I'm indebted to you.
Don't mention it.
How is it here?
Looks like you're not too happy.
You do what you have to do.
You don't have to do anything.
Yeah I do.
You had a poem.
What happened?
Really good!
You've got talent!
I try to write.
What are you up to?
Various stuff...
Like what?
That's really good.
Thanks.
You keep it.
I gotta go.
Could you type these for me
and send them to Olu?um?
OK.
I'll see you in a week.
Thank you.
See you then.
Look there is some
soap left over there.
I'm home.
What did you do?
Could you sell the milk?
I did.
- They want it every day.
- Great!
This came for you.
When did it come?
Two days ago.
Everybody else got one.
I wondered where mine was.
What is it?
My military draft notice.
I have to go to ?zmir...
...to take the medical exam.
What are we going to do?
Those who have ever had a serious illness,
surgery, use a prosthesis...
...should remain.
The others may leave.
Look up...
...down.
To the left...
...to the right...
Do you have
your medical report with you?
Come tomorrow
and get your results.
Do you have the Siir Ati journal?
Just a second.
Siir Ati isn't being published anymore.
Really?
How do you know?
Haydar Bey told me.
- You know Haydar Bey?
- Yes.
- He's my favorite poet!
- Mine too.
- I'm Yusuf.
- Semra.
- Nice to meet you.
- Me too.
You're a milkman?
So what are you doing around here?
I came for a physical.
Are you sick?
No. For the Army.
Have you ever had any poems published?
Yes, in the D?slerjournal.
At the bookstore...
I looked but it hadn't
come to the store yet.
Do you write too?
No. I don't write.
I did try to write a few poems
in the past...
And?
I couldn't finish any of them.
They're still not complete.
I'd like to read it.
My poems?
I'm not sure. I mean...
How would that be?
We could meet tomorrow if you want.
I have classes.
What time does it end?
Around 4.
What if I wait for you
at the bookshop at 4?
The bookshop, OK.
See you then at the bookstore after 4?
See you then.
- Nice meeting you.
- Same here.
Thank you.
Take this sweetie.
Thank you.
I guess your son's not here tonight?
He went to his Army physical
in Izmir.
He's going into the Army?
God willing!
Yusuf G?ner!
Who is it?
Milkman.
I brought your milk.
There hasn't been any milkman
around here for days.
You said you would bring milk everyday!
We did.
My mother brought the milk.
Nobody has brought any milk around here.
And I trusted you.
I don't want your milk anymore.
Don't bother to come back!
Who is it?
Milkman. Open the door!
I don't want any milk.
The biggest soldier is our soldier!
