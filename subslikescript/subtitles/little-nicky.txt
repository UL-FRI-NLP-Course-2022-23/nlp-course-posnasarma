Rough day at the office,
Mrs. Dunleavy?
You'll feel better

those work clothes.

And into some sweats.
(CHUCKLES)
Ah...
Oh. I wish you'd let me

Of course,
I wouldn't use my hands.

Oh. Scottie Dunleavy?
What unfortunate timing.
Get out.
Don't you know

(TELEPHONE RINGS)
I'll get it.
Hello?
Hello, Scottie.
Say, why don't you
be a good little boy,
go downstairs,
let your mother get
comfy, all right?
Who is this?
This is a big bird
who wants to see
the rest of Mommy.
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

Oh, oh.
Oh, my God, Scottie.
Is that a man up our tree?
No, no.

Knock, knock.
Hey, Jimmy.
What are you doing, Nicky?
I'm just jammin'.
Your father wants to see
you and your brothers
down in the throne room.
He's not retiring today,
is he?
He just wants to talk to you
and Cassius and Adrian
about who's gonna rule Hell
for the next 10,000 years.
Well, what do
I need to go for?
He's not gonna pick me.
(LAUGHS) I happen to think
you'd make a great devil.
No, I'm not into
evil and torture
and all that stuff.
Plus,
the Prince of Darkness
should have sort of
a distinguished look to him,
and let's face facts,
I'm no George Clooney.
(WHEEZING LAUGH)
You know, you're not
a bad-looking guy, Nicky.
Look at you
in that picture.
Yeah, I used to
talk normal, too,
but that was before
my brother Cassius
hit me in the face
with a shovel.
That's me now,
and I accept it.
Well, your brothers
are two of the sickest guys
I have ever seen.
For some reason,
you're not.
It's nothin'
to be ashamed of.
Well, their mothers
were fire dragons
and my mother was a goat,
so how am I gonna
compete with that?
Your mother
was not a goat.
Your brothers are
just playing with you.
Either way, if one of
those psychos gets picked,
I'm doomed.
CASSIUS: I knew it, Adrian.
He's finally retiring.
Cassius, I've been
waiting on this day
for 10,000 years.
Whew.
If the old man picks me
to take over Hell,
I'm gonna keep
torture going 24-7.
No breaks.
MAN: Whoa, Mama!
Ooh.
ADRIAN: You got him
right in the eye.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Hey.
Oh.
CASSIUS: How's Daddy's
little girl doing today?
Oh, I didn't see
you guys over there.
What's up?
(SNAPPING FINGERS)
Hey, shovel face,
you wanna mind-wrestle?
Actually, nah,
I'm all right.
I was thinking
of chiling out by the
throne for a little bit.
CASSIUS: I'm gonna
mind-wrestle you
whether you like it or not.
NICKY: Well,
I have to warn you,
I'm getting
pretty good at it.
CASSIUS: Then I guess
I can't make you do this.
(GROANS)
NICKY: Okay. Mercy.
You win. I give. Game over...
What are you boys doing?
(NICKY GROANING)
Nothing, Dad,
just hitting the old
punching bags.
Cassius, didn't I
tell you to stay out of
your brother's mind?
I forgot.
Maybe this will
help you remember.
Ah! Ooh!
Now, everybody
come sit down.
Hey, Dad.
Yes, son.
I... I know you got
a lot on your mind,
but I almost finished
that Monsters of Metal
compilation tape.
I really think
it's turning into
a masterpiece.
Okay, kid.
We'll listen to it later.
Thanks, thanks.
Oh, a window.
Hello, Mr. Devil,
I like your cape.
(WHEEZING LAUGH)
(SQUAWKING)
(SQUEALING)
(PEEPER GRUNTING)
I deserve this!
Fellas, this, as some
of you might know,
is my 10,000th year
as Prince of Darkness,
so I think the time
has come to discuss
who will succeed me.
Uh, knock, knock.
Yes, Jimmy?
Don't forget.
You're shoving a pineapple
up Hitler's ass at 4:00 p.m.
This was a very
difficult decision,
because I have
three wonderful sons.
I mean, Adrian,
so smart, so ruthless.
Wears makeup.
And Cassius,
so strong, so tough.
Don't forget
clinically insane.
And Nicky...
Such a sweet boy.
(LAUGHS)
But after much thought
and careful consideration,
I've decided that the ruler
for the next 10,000 years
is going to have to be...
Me.
BOTH: What?
Hallelujah.
I mean, that sucks.
The important thing for
the stability of our rule
is to maintain the balance
between good and evil,
and I don't think
any of you
are ready for
that responsibility yet.
Dad, this is bullshit!
I don't like
that language.
Ahem.
Right, right.
Send him in.
Sorry, boys.
I have to get back to work.
NICKY: Well, it was good
hanging with you, Dad.
I'll check you later.
(SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Mmm-mmm.
(GRUNTS)
Mmm-hmm.
You're schnerious?
HITLER: Ah!
Off, off, off, off, off.
Ah...
Damn!
20,000 years ago,
Grandpa Lucifer said,
"It's better to rule in Hell
than to serve in Heaven."
Well, I'm tired
of serving in Hell.
We need somewhere
where we can rule.
(ROARS)
(LAUGHS)
Bring it on, big man.
Let's see what you got.
(WHIMPERS)
(LAUGHS)
Could you concentrate
for five seconds?
I am concentrating, man.
I'm sorry.
After careful consideration,
I must respectfully decline.
I can't stand retirement.
Come on. Just let me
win one Super Bowl.
In exchange for eternal
damnation of your soul?
You're much
too nice a guy
for me to want to do
that to you, Mr. Marino.
You did it for Namath.
Yeah, but Joe was
coming here anyways.
This sucks.
I'll just go
to the Super Bowl
as an announcer,
and I'll win myself
an Emmy!
That's the spirit.
You're a good devil, Dad.
And I also happen
to be a Jets fan.
(LAUGHS)
What do you
think about Earth?
We could create
our own Hell there.
Are you saying we can go up
there and kill everyone?
Eventually, Cassius,
but first,
we'd have to corrupt
as many souls as we can,
so that when
we do destroy them--
Their damned souls
will be ours.
It's our time, brother.
(PEOPLE YELLING)
(BOTH GRUNTING)
This is not good.
This is not good.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Fellas, what are you doing?
BOTH: We're leaving.
GATEKEEPER:
You can't go through there!
The fire flows in,
not out.
(BOTH YELLING)
You really suck!
Your Evilness!
Your Evilness!
Cassius and Adrian
have escaped from Hell.
They went out
through the fire,
and they froze it.
I tried to stop them, sir,
but they overpowered me.
(SOBBING)
Calm down.
Get off your knees.
Thank you for being
so understanding,
Your Wickedness.
You're the man.
You've always been the man.
I've always said that.
Oh. Oh.
Are there boobs
on my head?
Yeah, big ones.
What's going on, Dad?
I'm going to die, Nicky.
The gates are broken.
No new souls can get in,
which means I'll start
to deteriorate into nothing.
No. No.
What's with all those
"hoo hoo" noises?
Everything's fine, Pop.
Everything's fine?
Who are you bullshitting?
The last time you said
everything was fine,
the Renaissance happened.
Please, Pop,
go back to your room.
Hey, can I take him with me?
Sure, Pop.
Whatever you want.
Tit-head,
go with my father.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(JIMMY KNOCKS ON ICE)
Not a damn soul is going
to get through that.
This fire is solid as rock.
We got to get this
bad boy burning again.
To do that,
Cassius and Adrian
have to come back
through the other way.
So go get 'em, Dad.
I'm too weak.
The process
has already begun.
(WHIMPERS)
So go get 'em, Jimmy.
I'm just a demon.
I don't have
Devil blood in me.
I... I wouldn't last
two minutes with
your brothers up there.
Are you saying
it's up to me?
Huh?
You said no souls
could get through that.
Nicky, are you a soul,
or are you
the spawn of Satan?
I never been to Earth, Dad.
I never even slept over
some other dude's house.
Nicky, the worst thing
that could happen on Earth
is you get killed,
in which case, boom.
You end up back here.
So you're saying
I need to go to Earth
and kill my brothers?
No go.
They left together
at the exact same time.
They got
to come back together
at the exact same time.
Here.
Get them
to drink from this.
One sip, and they'll be
trapped inside.
Once you've got
both of them,
you bring the flask
back through the gate.
Let me, sir.
Gross!
(SNIFFS) Ugh.
He's got
less than a week.

That's a train, son.
Don't stand
in front of them.
Well, I'll have to take
a mulligan on this one.
Please, Nicky,
get back up there.
All right. Whoa!
I'll get that
for you, sir.

That's terrific.
Now get off the track

I just want to find

Only she had more hair.

ADRIAN: Little Nicky.
VALERIE: Know what's
nice about you?
NICKY: What?
I like the way you're happy
just being yourself.
You don't try to act cool.
Thanks much, Valerie.
You know what's
nice about you?
(SCREECHING)
(STRUGGLING) Your juicy
heart-shaped heinie.
What was that?
I don't know
why I said that.
I... I meant
to say that...
I've always dreamt
about having sex
with a gross pig.
(GASPS)
Can I wash my winky
in your kitchen sinky?
You're a real jerk!
I didn't mean to be.
NICKY: What the... Adrian!
(ADRIAN LAUGHING)
Dad needs you
to come back to Hell.
ADRIAN: So he sent
old shovel face to fetch me.
I'm not kidding.
He's in trouble.
So are you.
Hey, Valerie!
(SHOUTS)
What is your problem?
I'm sorry!
(WHIMPERS)
Adrian, you guys
froze the fire gate
and now Dad is dying,
so get your booty
back home or else!
You can't talk tough, Nicky.
Even the voice
inside your head has
a speech impediment.
Adrian,
you're gonna go back
because I'm gonna
make you go back.
How about this?
I'll stay here,
enjoying my pizza
and my peppermint schnapps,
and you go back.
Adrian, don't!
Cut the crap!
This is serious!
Oh, come on.
(BOTH LAUGH)
So I was driving
to work today,
some bozo in a Cadillac
cuts me off.
So I followed him.
When he got out of his car,
I run up behind this guy,
and I start bashing
his brains in with this bat.
(AUDIENCE GASP)
Did you ever see
The Untouchables?
I was De Niro!
What's happened
to you, Regis?
Mmm-hmm.
The Mayor's office
today, in conjunction
with the New York
Board of Tourism,
unveiled its new motto
to replace the long-standing
"I love New York" slogan.
"I love hookers" will now be
the city's catch phrase.
(SWITCHES TV OFF)
Your brothers are
upsetting the balance
between good and evil.
Oh, what can I do about it?
You can't do jack shit
unless you learn
your evil powers.
Go get a soda
out of the fridge.
But those are
my roommate's sodas.
(IN MOCKING TONE)
"But those are my
roommate's sodas."
Does that sound
like a statement
the son of the Devil
would make?
All right.
Take it easy.
Nicky, you have
the power to change
the cola in that can
into any other liquid.
Engine oil, bat's blood,
moose piss.
You just have to release
the evil within.
Release the evil?
I'm just saying
there's wickedness in you.
I can tell from your snores.
Really?
Release your evil.
Release the evil.
Come on, you can do it.
There it is.
You got it in you.
(BUBBLING)
What are you doing?
Hey!
Oh! I... I...
All right.
I'm going to pretend
I didn't see a dog
on the couch,
because my brain just can't
process that right now.
But were you about
to drink one of my Cokes?
No. I was
just looking at it.
It's beautiful.
(OPENS CAN)
(SLURPS)
(GULPS)
This Coke
tastes like Pepsi.
You changed a Coke
into a Pepsi?
That was your
big transformation?
Come on, man,
give it up a little.
I mean, it was pretty good
for my first try.
Do you even care
that your brothers
are killing your father?
Yes, I care!
And he is not
going to die!
(GLASS EXPLODES)
Atta boy.
I'm freaked out.
My television just blew up.
You're damn right it did!
I mean, really?
I know this is
your living room time,
but could I maybe finish
watching the Globetrotters
out here?
It's the craziest game
I've ever seen.
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
He's walking! Get him a bus!
This is the part
I don't get.
Another terrible call.
There's no way
that was traveling.
What's up
with all the calls?
We haven't lost
a game in 53 years!
Guess what, cornrows?
Technical foul!
You're outta here!
(LAUGHING)
(BOOING)
Why's the referee
being so mean to
the Globetrotters, Daddy?
I've been watching
these guys play
since I was your age.
It's all part
of the show, baby.
(SNAPPING FINGERS)
That guy in
the striped shirt
snapped his fingers
like somebody I know!
(CACKLING)
(PLAYERS GRUNTING)
(LAUGHING)
Normally
the Globetrotters represent
family entertainment.
Who gives a shit?
(KIDS SOBBING)
These kids came here to see
the Globetrotters win!
Ten points off on
the Globetrotters
on account of the bigmouth!
(CACKLES)
(CROWD BOOING)
It's all part of
the show, baby!
(LAUGHS)
Hit the half-time buzzer.
I'm tired.
COMMENTATOR:
If the second half doesn't
get any better than this,
you can expect
a full-scale riot.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is now time
for the Globetrotters'
half-time half-court
heave-ho throw!
And if the contestant
makes it,
everyone here
will get a free pizza pie!
I ain't takin' the shot.
These people are crazy.
Excuse me.
I'll take that shot.
Okay.
What made you
want to come and see the
Globetrotters today, son?
I came for the beer
and the bitches.
Oh.

(LAUGHS) Yeah!
MAN: (OVER P.A.)
Please welcome Miguel Sanchez
from the Bronx,
New York!
What's Nicky doing there?
Trying to capture
his brother in a flask
and preserve the balance
of good and evil on Earth.
Did you just talk?
No.
Are you Miguel
from the Bronx?
No. I'm Nicky
from the South.
Hey, gimme that!
(YELLING)
You better win these people
some free pizza
'cause it looks like
they're about to start
killing each other.
All right.
Who's that man, Mommy?
I don't know,
but he sure is
butt-ugly.
Release the evil.
(CROWD GASP)
Too much evil.
I think
that ball just blew up,
and, yes,
my hair is aflame.
I don't know what
the hell that was.
Don't do it again, huh?
All right.
I command you
not to blow up
and go into
that metal circle.
(GRUNTS)
Nyah!
Hey.
Get that crap outta here!
(SHOUTING)
NICKY: I know you're
having fun, Cassius,
but you really gotta
come back to Hell.
CASSIUS:
Look around you, Nicky.
We're in Hell.
The new Hell.
(LAUGHING)
Do it! Do it! Do it!
Whee!
(LAUGHING)
I was sent here
to take you back
and that's what
I'm gonna do.
Don't make me take out
the shovel again, trick.
I think we're about to see
a Devil showdown.
Yeah!
(LAUGHS)
You know, Dad got sick
when you guys left.
I'm glad he's dying
'cause it's my turn now.
You're gonna wish
you never said that.
Take him to the hole, Nicky.
I mean, woof-woof.
Come on, brother,
come on! Ha-ha!
Oh, come on!
(LAUGHING)
Daddy can't help you!
Daddy can't help you!
(SCREAMING)
Enough!
(ALL CHEERING)
This show gets
better every year!
(LAUGHING)
That was sick.
Who taught you that shit?
Sorry, Cassius.
It must be the Super
Devil juice Dad gave me.
Super Devil juice?
Gimme that, little girl.
Don't drink
out of it, please!
(SLURPS)
(SCREAMING)
Now that was some straight-up
David Copperfield shit!
CASSIUS: Damn you, Nicky!
There ain't no Super
Devil juice in here!
JOHN: Hail, Nicky!
We are forever
your slaves!
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
So your father's
the Devil...
Si, senor.
You're a talking dog
from Hell.
Yep.
And you guys are who?
Just a couple of
big fans of Nicky
and the work
his dad does.
Hey, by the way, Nicky,
check this out.
(PLAYING RECORD BACKWARDS)
What's Ozzy trying
to say there?
John, absolutely nothing.

straight with his messages.
But wrap your minds

Oh, my God,

(LAUGHING)
That was awesome.
You know, guys,
this cake tastes
a little funny.
Oh, I dumped a fat sack
of reefer in the mix.
Thought I'd spice up the bash.
Really?
What's reefer?
About 500 bucks an ounce.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Come on, Nicky,
one more time.
I can't.
It's starting to hurt.
Come on,
you totally got to!
All right, all right.
Last time.
TODD: Oh, here he goes!
Here he goes!
(SNARLING)
(BONES CRACK)
That's insane!
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
(LAUGHING)
I used to get
messed up like this
with my first
girlfriend Heather.
We'd get so loopy,
she would forget
I was a dog.
She was a human?
No. She was a sewer rat.
(LAUGHING)
Man, that pissed
my parents off.
You know,
I was in love once,
but she said I wasn't
financially reliable
and she needed that.
Now, by "she,"
do you mean "he"?
No.
Busted!
(ALL LAUGHING)
Please.
Hey, how you feelin'
over there,
Satan Abdul-Jabbar?
A little strange.
I can't stop thinking
about this girl Valerie.
Why? Did she hurt you?
Do you need to cry
on my shoulder?
Easy, Liberace.
Oh, would you grow up?
(LAUGHS) Liberace.
I was having
the best day with her
until Adrian
made me tell her
she had
a heart-shaped heinie.
Maybe you love her.
But what do I know?
I can't even
see straight.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Oh, me, too!
Hey, we got to get going.
Hey, you guys can
crash here if you want.
I have an extra futon
in the bedroom.
Uh, that's a big pass,
Elton John.
(LAUGHTER)
Ozzy starts in 30 minutes.
Maybe that'll
cheer you up, Nicky.
Yeah, let's roll.
Actually, I don't think
I can give the Ozz man
the full focus he deserves.
Sorry, fellas.
Oh. This chick must be
the real deal, then.
Later, bro.
Good-bye, John.
Okay, Pete.
You better snap out
of it soon, kid,
'cause we're going
after Adrian tomorrow
bright and early.
Night-night.
Yeah, I know.
Get some
sleep thing, Mr. Beefy.

Look, just because

That wasn't me.
I was being possessed
by my brother Adrian.
What do you mean,

Yes.
Well, that's because
he's the Devil,

And that pissed off

so they broke
the gates of Hell,

Good morning, New York.
This is an Action News
special report.
A shocking crime
results in a record
$50 million reward
for the capture
of this man.
His name is unknown,
but his actions
have earned him
the label "The Monster."
He should be
considered armed and
extremely dangerous.
...the man who caused
such a sensation
at the game yesterday
is no hero.
He is, in fact,
a mass murderer.
This is real bad.
BEEFY: Where
the heck is Nicky?
...I have
authorized a reward
to the person who
brings this man to me.
BEEFY: It's a setup.

All in the hips, yeah!
Nobody in this room will
tell you a thing, Adrian.
Right!
Oh, oh!
Hey, let him go!
Perhaps a titty-twister
will loosen your lips.
No, no. Ah!
Ooh, hey,
I'm gettin' turned on.
Okay, okay!
All I know...
Yes?
...is that if you
sit on that throne
in your father's
weakened condition...
Tit-head, no!
You can claim
the seat of power
for your own.
Whoa! Ah!
Really?
As the founder of Hell,
I command you
to stay off that throne!
Hey!
Even in Hell
I get no respect.
Put me down.
Put me down!
No!
Oh!

(GIGGLING)
So where did
you meet Dad?
Oh, it was a long time ago
at this Heaven-Hell mixer.
I remember that night.
You had, like,
four daiquiris.
At first I didn't
really like him.
He was really conceited.
HOLLY: Yeah, but he was funny.
And I hate to admit it,
but he had a really hot body.
(GIGGLING)
(DOG BARKING)
Oh, puppy phone.
It's so cute.
Hello?
Hi, Michelle.
Yeah, he's here right now.
I don't know if he's hot.
He's my son, you perv.
Can I call you back?
(BARK)
That was my friend Michelle.
She says hi.
Say hi back.
(BARK)
I'll just call her later.
You know, Nicky,
we totally saw you save
your girlfriend's life.
That was so cool.
Yeah, that's why you came
to Heaven instead of Hell.
Self-sacrifice
automatically gets you here.
How did you see me?
We can see anything that's
going on on Earth. Look.
Someone else is taking
the internship.
HOLLY: Oh, that's
Felicity.
I love that show.
Do you watch?
I haven't seen it,
but I hear good things.
I don't want to go
to Colorado.
This is an Action News
special report.
Moments ago, a large chunk
of what appears to be Hell
began to rise
from beneath Central Park.
Far from being terrified,
many New Yorkers have begun
flocking to the site,
turning it into
an unofficial party central.
And this just in...
I'm cheating on my husband
with the weatherman.
Show him Central Park.
I love your legs.
(CHEERING AND YELLING)
(SCREAMING)
(LAUGHING)
(RUMBLING)
ADRIAN: Yeah!
(LAUGHING)
NICKY: That's
my father's throne!
Is Dad okay?
Let's see.
I was a good Devil,
wasn't I?
You were
the best devil, sir!
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
The best Devil!
If we fall in there,
we will die. Period.
My underwear is so far
up my ass I could taste it.
I hear that.
(MOANING)
ADRIAN: Welcome to the party!
(CHEERING)
It's so nice
to see you all here.
(GROANS)
I'm so proud of you.
You've taken to sin
with such minimal prompting.
(CHEERING)
You're acting as if there
is no Heaven or Hell.
(CHEERING)
Well, I've got news for you.
There is most definitely
a Hell.
ALL: What?
And you're all going
to go there when you die.
Which is in about
15 minutes.
Holy shit,
we really are gonna die!
(SCREAMING AND YELLING)
Ah!
I'm really burning now!
What are we gonna do?
I gotta help her.
I gotta help Dad.
I gotta help everybody.
At the stroke of midnight,
my father will be
completely deteriorated,
and all your souls
will be mine.
Soon you will see things
more horrible
than you can even imagine.
(MOANING)
Well, maybe not
that horrible,
but still pretty bad.
(MOANING)
So, while we wait,
for your enjoyment,
I bring you
a dear, sweet man,
Mr. Henry Winkler.
(CROWD CHEERING)
Good evening.
Covered in bees!
(BUZZING)
Ah!
Ew!
How can I win?
Adrian is stronger
and smarter than me.
Stronger, yes.
Smarter, definitely.
But you have something
that he doesn't have.
A speech impediment?
No!
The inner light, honey.
And you can totally use it.
It's the best power of all.
I do?
And God told me
if you get in really
bad trouble,
you can use this.
What is it?
Okay, I'm not totally
100 percent on that,
but God said
when the time came,
you'd know
what to do with it.
God's so smart.
Like Jeopardy
smart.
(SIGHS) Mmm.
My little boy.
Mommy...
Get me
to the Big Apple,
'cause I'm gonna
rock that town
like a hurricane.
You're already there.
Bye, Nicky.
Bye, Mom.
Bye.
Bye, guys.
Bye.
DEMONS: Nicky!
(YELLING)
(YELLS ORDERS)
Release the good.
Ah...
(DEMONS YELLING)
Release the good.
Yes, they're furry.
DEMONS: Bunny, bunny,
bunny, bunny.
Release the awesome.
What you do is
put it in your mouth
and let the meat slide
down your throat hole.
Not you, not you!
Popeyes chicken
is the shizzney!

(ADRIAN LAUGHING)
You know,
from this angle,
you're kind of cute.
You think so?
(GULPS)
Oh, my God.
He just opened his mouth
and swallowed that spit.
Oh, that turn you on
there, RuPaul? (LAUGHS)
(JOHN AND PETE LAUGHING)
(SNIFFING)
(FLAPPING)

NICKY: Excuse me. Pardon me.
Little Nicky.
ALL: Yeah, Nicky!
Nicky!
I knew you would make it!
NICKY: Adrian...
I'm asking you nicely.
Let my friends alone,
and get in the flask.
Is this a joke?
No, it's the inner light,
and with it,
we can defeat
whatever you got.
It's true!
Ah!
It's not true!
(CLUCKING)
ADRIAN: Run, traitors, run!
Okay, Adrian.
You've left me
no choice.
Whoa!
(CHEERING)
ADRIAN: Ah, th-th-th-th.
Leave this to me.
Let's see
what you've got.
Okay.

I'm ready for you.
I guess I wasn't ready.
(VIBRATED YELLING)
(SCREAMING)
(EXCLAIMS)
I totally
had to do that.
Yes!
Hell, yeah, you did.
Great job!
That's great!
Thanks, Mom!
(GRUNTS)
(SCREAMING)
(GROANS)
Now, I'm gonna
ask you nicely.
Get in the fla...
Oh! Oh, you want
a pillow fight, do you?
Well, let's let
the feathers fly.
Come on, now.
Come on.
I'm right here.
Where am I going
with it, baby?
Here I am.
(MUTTERING)
(GRUNTS)
I'm sleeping.
(SNORING)
Or am I?
(CHEERING)
Thanks, Mr. Winkler.
Now, I'm asking you
one last time.
Get in the flask.
A little help here, please.
(PANTING) Please!
Don't do this! No!
(WHINING)
Good-bye, Nicky. Ah.
Ah!
No! Whoa!
Ow!
CASSIUS:
Nice to see you, brothers.
Now I'm gonna bust both
of your heads wide open!
ADRIAN: No, no!

(ADRIAN GROANING)
(SMACKING AND GRUNTING)
Come on!
Get 'em, Nicky!
Fight 'em, Nick!
You can do it, Nicky!

in his hairy balls!
NICKY: Good idea.
(GROANING)
(CHEERING)
NICKY: One down,
one to go, Adrian.
ADRIAN:
You've asked for this.
Time for the shovel!
NICKY: Bring it on!

Kill him, Adrian!
Shut up!
Get him, Nicky!
ADRIAN: Let go of me!

NICKY: Ah.

VALERIE: Nicky!
Yay!
(CHEERING)
Oh, yeah!
Whoo-hoo!
Nicky!
How did a nice
Southern boy like you
learn to fight
like that?
I guess from my father's
side of the family.
(GIGGLING)
CROWD: Aw.
(RESISTING) Mmm!
Uh-oh.
(ADRIAN'S VOICE)
What? No tongue?

PETE: That is wicked!

Whoo!

(CROWD GROANS)
(GASPS) Whoo.
You gotta fly out.
Soon it will all be mine!
Nicky! I know
you can do it.
Run, run!
Do it for the butterflies.
NICKY: Butterflies?
(GASPS)
Oh, the power of good
lets you fly out.
Well, you're
too late, Nicky!
Behold your new Satan!
What... What's that?
What's with the ball?

Ozzy?
Holy shit.
Not... No, no, no, no!
You can do it, Ozzy!

VALERIE:
Here you go, Ozzy.

Grand Central, Nicky!
TODD: Start running.
You'll never make it.
You've gotta die.
I'll just go to Heaven.
Not if you do something bad
right before you die.
You're right.
Hey, Nicky!
Cover Winkler in bees!
You can do it!
Sorry, Henry.

Okay, do me!
With what?
I don't know.
I don't know!

You came through, Nicky.
I came through

and I came
through for Mom
and the butterflies.
You're back
in Hell now, kid.
There are
no butterflies here.
If you want butterflies,
you need to be on Earth.
What about
you and Grandpa
and everybody
in Hell?
Nicky...
I let my butterflies die
once upon a time,
and it's never
stopped hurting.
That's right!
You heard me, Holly.
What?
I'm still in love
with you!
Oh, my God,
he's talking about me.
And don't think I forgot
about how crazy you get
after a few daiquiris.
(SIGHS)
That guy is still
the biggest horndog.
Yeah, he is.
Listen, I got down low.
Your mom's got up high.
You take care
of the middle.
Okay, Dad.
But...

of Motley Crue,
this will always be
my home sweet home.
Don't be afraid
