Want something to eat?
No.
- You know what?
- H mm?
We should get out of Calgary for a few days.
You know, just take orf.
Anyplace special?
Somewhere where we can be
alone together.
More alone than this?
Yeah.
No work, no telephone calls.
- No bad dreams.
- No bad dreams.
Mm...
Decker's been calling again.
When?
All last week, every day.
And what does he want?
I don't know, I haven't talked to him.
I haven't called him back.
Well, if he can help...
I'm just... so frustrated.
You spend all that time
working with somebody, and...
Look, go see him.
OK? Tell him it's all gone except
the bad dreams.
The dreams aren't even
that bad anymore.
I'm actually beginning to like them.
That does sound crazy,
now, doesn't it?
Cos I like being fat because it's comfortable,
and I like myself fat.
- And I like you fat, too!
- Keep it down, you'll wake the munchkins!
Mommy...
Sweetie, you're supposed
to be beddy-byes!
I heard something.
- What did you hear, honey?
- A bad man.
Oh, everything's all right.
You go back to bed, munchkin,
and I'll come and see you a bit later, OK?
OK.
You know, most of my colleagues would've
walked away from a case like yours.
But I found you intriguing.
All that talk about monsters and Midian.
Only I didn't create 'em,
I heard about 'em from other people.
Yeah, but you've incorporated it
into your private mythology.
Yeah, I guess I did.
I needed a place to escape to.
A place where all your sins
would be forgiven.
- Yeah.
- Do you remember what sins?
What do you mean?
Well, when you imagined yourself
being taken away to this...
invented city, to Midian,
what sins were you gonna be forgiven?
Are we back in therapy, Doctor?
They were just dreams.
Midian doesn't exist.
Monsters don't exist.
But murder does, Aaron.
Murder is very, very real.
It might start in the mind...
but then it changes to flesh and blood.
Two days ago, the police
brought me some photographs.
They wanted to know
if any of my patients
was capable of doing
what's in those photographs.
I'm gonna show them to you.
Why?
Because when you talked
about murder on the tapes,
I assumed it was just hallucination.
That's what I assumed.
What you described
on those tapes, Aaron,
was very detailed.
Very specific.
Houses, faces.
These houses. These faces.
No, I... I don't remember.
- Would you like to hear it?
- No.
- So you think I did this?
- Six families killed in ten months, Aaron.
Oh, God!
So what am I gonna do?
You're gonna take these.
They'll help you.
You've got 24 hours to go to the police
and tell them the truth.
And that's all I can give you.
Boone?
'This is Boone.
'You know what to do.
Adlos. '
'Yeah, hi, it's me.
'I'm at my place and I thought
you were gonna be here.
'So, erm... so come over
as soon as you get this, OK?'
I love you. Bye.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
- What have you been taking tonight?
- Lithium.
Lucky you're in one piece, fella.
- This is not Lithium, my friend.
- What was I taking?
It looks like it could be some kind
of lab quality hallucinogen.
You're on what we used to call
a bad trip, ol' buddy.
'Six families killed in ten months, Aaron.
'Six families killed in ten months, Aaron. '
Please take me.
Take me to Midian!
Take me to Midian,
I'll do anything!
Have I missed you?
Have I missed you? No.
Please come. Please come.
Please come. Come and take me.
Take me to Midian!
Please take me.
Take me!
Take me to Midian!
Please, I beg you.
I'll do anything.
- Why won't you come?
- What'd you say?
I said shut up!
They won't come while you're here.
They won't show themselves
to the likes of you.
What'd you just say?
- What'd you just say?
- You said "Midian".
- Did I? Maybe.
- What do you know about it?
It's where the monsters go.
It takes away the pain.
Hey, wait a minute...
- What do you know about it?
- They forgive you there.
See, they only take you
if you're worthy.
You know what they do to those
that... aren't worthy?
So you know where it is?
You and I could go there.
- They sent you.
- What?
They sent you to take me.
Yes.
Yeah...
but I need to know where it is.
It's a test.
Yes. Yes.
North of Athabasca.
East of Peace River.
North of Dwyer.
You'll take me. I'm worthy,
you ask anyone!
I knew you'd come.
I was... I was waiting!
Good.
I know, I know, I know.
I know. I know.
First, I have to show you.
That's how it works.
- Show me what?
- My true face.
That's what these are for.
I'm an actor, see?
There's a face beneath this face.
- No!
- Let me! You have to see me!
First I show you,
then you take me with you!
J uvenile delinquency,
periodically institutionalised,
some violent episodes.
No criminal charges,
and he's been in my care...
- What the hell have you done?
- Nothing!
I n there!
They need help!
What's he saying?
He's not making
a whole lot of sense.
Something about
a place called "Midian".
He's dying.
I think he wants to die.
I nspector, I know Boone.
I know how he talks,
I know how he manipulates.
Now, maybe if the right words
are said to this man,
they'll trigger something.
Go ahead.
I'll do what I can...
but I'll have to have privacy.
Move and I'll slit your throat!
- You've got him?
- I've got him.
Holy shit!
Are you from Midian?
- We should take him below, Peloquin.
- He's not N ightbreed.
- He's natural.
- No, I've killed people!
I... I'm like you.
That's why I'm here.
Shut the fuck up.
You're meat.
If we eat him
we break the law!
- That's true.
- Everything's true.
God's an astronaut.
Oz is over the rainbow.
And Midian is where
the monsters live.
And you came to die.
I didn't come to die.
I came to be with you.
No. Sorry.
I can smell innocence...
...from 50 yards.
I've killed people.
I've killed 15 people!
- Who told you that?
- What do you mean?
He lied, asshole!
You're natural.
That means...
you're meat...
for the beast.
We mustn't! It's the law!
Fuck the law.
I want meat.
Let him go!
Peloquin, no!
He's meat. He's meat!
That way.
The gate's that way!
Run while you've still got legs!
He's gone! Enough!
Peloquin!
No!
What?
Something... natural.
Freeze! Aaron Boone,
you're under arrest!
Boone, listen to him.
It's no use.
Stay back!
I nspector,
I know how to talk to him.
Boone, it's gonna be OK.
They know everything now.
I've explained everything to them.
They're not gonna hurt you.
I didn't do it.
I didn't hurt anyone!
- Of course you didn't.
- Then you believe me?
I believe you.
He's got a gun!
No! Hold your fire!
I said hold your goddamn fire!
Where's the gun?
He reached into his jacket.
Ms Winston, can you identify this
as the body of Aaron Boone?
You know, you meant
the world to Aaron.
He used to talk about you
all the time.
He talked a lot about you, too.
We don't have to do this right now,
Ms Winston.
No, I'd really rather
just get it over with.
What was your relationship
with the deceased?
We were lovers.
Deceased is male,
white Caucasian, late-20s.
Possible cause of death multiple gunshot
wounds to thoracic cavity and extremities.
U nspecified animal bite adjacent
bullet wound on upper lert shoulder.
Bullet wound number one,
upper lert shoulder.
Second bullet wound
above lert nipple.
Third bullet wound
below costal margin, to the lert.
Jesus, they weren't
taking any chances!
He never raised a hand to me.
He never hurt anyone in his life.
Ms Winston...
everybody has a secret face.
Corfee break.
Sweet dreams.
Where did he die?
What was the name of the town?
It was a place called Midian.
'Is it always the same dream then?'
'No, sometimes it's like I'm, uh...
'I don't know, it's...
It's like I'm underground.
'I'm in Midian, in a place full of monsters,
I told you about it. '
'Are you buried alive?'
'No. Not a lot. '
'But you're conscious?'
'Yeah, but not alive.
I'm dead, but I'm still functioning. '
'Death is the end, Boone. '
'Not in Midian, it isn't.
'I n Midian, I live forever.
'So maybe death isn't the end, Doc. '
- What'll it be, darling?
- Yeah, uh, drart.
Drart coming up.
I'm looking for a place called Midian.
You're not the only one.
Bunch of TV news folk passing through,
ever since they nailed
that baby slasher up there.
- Baby slasher?
- Yeah, been a hell of a week for us.
Took 30 shots to bag that sucker.
What is it?
Men or money?
Whenever I cry,
it's usually men or money.
A man.
What'd he do?
Leave?
Not exactly.
He didn't come back, did he?
That's even worse.
Some loser gets a crush on you,
you could throw him in the river,
tied to a piano,
he'd come back
faster than a dog with a bone.
Why I bother to look so good
when there's no one here to admire
the end product is beyond me.
Know what I mean?
Yeah, I can't argue with that.
Do you want a drink?
I want a drink.
You'll enjoy this.
No, really.
You hit me again and I'm gonna
rip your face orf.
It's just a way to say
welcome to the club.
I'm not so sure
I want to be in the club.
You found your way back here
for the same reason I did.
We belong here.
There's no place else on Earth
that would take us in.
Go on in.
They're waiting for you.
That's Lylesberg, the boss.
Who's that girl?
Shuna Sassi. Why?
- I dreamt about her.
- I dreamt him.
- Who is your advocate?
- I am.
Have you tutored him in the law?
- Yes, he has.
- Let the advocate answer.
Yes, I have.
You understand what you do,
joining us here?
Tonight, you leave
the natural world behind.
The life you lived will be a dream.
I know.
The blood of Baphomet
knows all truth.
Sorry.
Are you prepared
to be judged by the god?
Yes. I am.
Aaron Boone...
the Tribes of the Moon
embrace you.
You were wonderful.
Bon App?tit.
H I. How's your head?
Please...
But it was worth it.
Lori, my grandmother
always used to say,
"Sheryl Ann, there's a man walking around
out there with your name on his mind.
"All you gotta do is run into him."
Of course he happened to be checked
in here at the crossroads of the world?
He's fabulous.
H is name is Curtis
and he's a banker,
and he's just moved to Edmonton
since he got his divorce.
And best of all,
he thinks I'm wonderful.
Sheryl, are you sure
you want to come along?
Oh yeah, I wouldn't miss it.
Besides, Curtis has some business
to do today, but um...
But we're meeting tonight,
so that's OK.
- My God!
- Looks like the gold rush is over.
- Why the hell would Boone come out here?
- To get away from it all?
Shut up, Sheryl Ann.
Look, you go do
whatever it is you have to do.
I'll stay here and...
do something else.
Right, I'll see you later.
So this is Midian.
Curtis?
What are you doing here?
Hello, Sheryl Ann.
Bring her.
Please, bring her.
Don't be frightened.
Oh, great...
Pick her up.
OK, hold still.
Come on.
No, it's OK. It's all right.
H urry, please.
Bring her.
Please, bring her to me.
Pay no attention,
just give her to me.
What is this?
- Babette, no!
- What's happening to it?
What, is it sick?
- What's happening to it?
- Mommy, help me.
Jesus!
- What the hell is this?
- She likes to play outside.
I tell her the sun will hurt her,
but she's just a child.
She doesn't understand.
- She likes to play outside...
- You saved her.
I owe you something.
Listen, I know why you've come.
Is Boone here?
Did somebody bring him here?
Rachel, you have said
too much already.
But Lylesberg,
she saved Babette.
We know.
But you cannot help her.
Look...
I don't know who you people are,
but I saved the child's life, didn't I?
So don't I deserve something for that?
The child has no life to save.
But what it has is yours,
if you want it. That is the law.
Do you want her?
No! No, thanks.
No, I just want some answers.
But to speak of this, to anyone,
would bring dire consequences.
What is that, a threat?
Not to you. To us.
What's below...
remains below.
This is the law.
Boone. Aaron Boone.
J ust tell me, is he here?
You took him.
You took his body, didn't you?
I need to know.
Didn't you?
I'm sorry.
Please, don't go.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Where'd they go?
She's mine!
Y'all come back now,
you hear?
Sheryl, we're going.
I saw, uh...
Something's kinda come up.
And, um, I...
Sheryl?
Sheryl?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Lori.
- How do you know my name?
Oh, that's a good question.
- Here's the answer.
- Oh, no.
Boone's alive, Lori.
And your death is gonna
bring him out of hiding.
Somebody help me!
I'm not gonna let her die!
You made an oath to obey the law.
I'm not gonna let him
butcher her.
- No!
- Bitch!
- I love her.
- But she's a Natural.
She can't love you, not now.
I don't care!
Boone!
Boone!
Lie still... It's quicker that way.
Decker!
You're here.
Well, isn't this where the dead
are supposed to go?
But you're not dead.
You're wrong, Decker.
We're both dead.
Boone.
Don't you get it?
Blades are no better than bullets.
I'm dead.
I'm the walking dead.
Are you gonna kill him or not?
Only I want his balls.
And his eyes.
U nless, of course,
you want them?
I think I'll pass.
Remember me, Doctor?
I was dying when you had
your way with me.
You made me give up my secrets
when I was feeling particularly vulnerable.
Now...
No!
He's mine!
Pretty sweet.
No!
I wasn't gonna hurt her.
I only wanted to keep her warm.
She's not gonna like
the way you look.
You've put us all in danger
for your love of this woman.
- Decker won't tell anyone.
- He can still lead our enemies here.
If he does and Midian is unearthed,
you are responsible.
I'll make amends.
J ust take the girl, then go
on your way amongst the Naturals.
That is the law.
We've got visitors, boy.
May I use your phone?
Yeah. U h... don't know
if it works.
Broke down, did you?
Oh, you ain't gonna get nobody
to come out here.
Nobody never comes out here.
Get me I nspector Joyce.
Dr Philip Decker.
You been up to Midian?
- Kind of smelt like you had.
- Where exactly is the town of Midian?
There ain't no town, just cemetery.
Joyce? Decker.
Listen, I found out where Boone is.
- Where are the nearest police?
- Shere Neck.
Shere Neck.
Yes.
I'll meet you in Shere Neck.
- Who's buried in Midian?
- Dead folk.
Prospectors come from all over
and got buried up there.
- But there's something else.
- Ain't nothin' but dead folk.
Thanks.
Had to happen sooner or later.
They couldn't hide forever.
It's all right, boy.
It's all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Yeah.
Boone?
What the hell is this?
- It was Boone up there.
- Yes.
But Boone's dead,
I saw him in the morgue.
You still don't understand.
You're below now,
with the N ightbreed.
- The last survivors of the great tribes.
- OK, tribes of what?
We're shape shirters.
Freaks.
Remains of races that your tribe
have almost driven to extinction.
- So you're not immortal?
- Far from it.
The sun can kill some of us,
like Babette.
Some of us can be shot down.
Others can survive that
because they've gone beyond death.
This is too weird.
To be able to fly?
To be smoke?
Or a wolf?
To know the night
and live in it forever.
That's not so bad.
You call us monsters,
but when you dream,
you dream of flying and changing
and living without death.
You envy us.
And what you envy...
We destroy.
Babette? Show her.
Show her the past.
We are all that remain.
So you're saying...
You're saying that Boone's like you.
Yes. He's N ightbreed.
No, that's not possible.
- I've gotta find him.
- He's beyond your help.
- Where did he go?
- Down to the tabernacle. To Baphomet.
- Who's that?
- The baptizer, who made Midian,
who called us here
and saved us from our enemies.
- OK, take me there.
- It's forbidden.
We'll see about that.
I told you everything I know.
No, no. The monsters.
- N ightbreed?
- Can they die?
- What harm they ever done to you?
- Can they die!
- Yeah.
- How?
Well, there are all kinds of breed.
All kinds of ways to kill them.
U h, bullets for some,
and fire for others.
Why is it that you know
so much about them?
I wanted to be one of them.
Did they kick you out?
Is that why you hate them so much?
I'm not one of them.
I'm here to destroy them.
See, I've cleaned up
a lot of breeders.
Families like cesspools.
Filth making filth making filth.
And I did it over,
and over, and over again.
But it was all leading me here.
I was born to destroy Boone
and the breed together.
- You're crazy!
- No, I'm death.
Plain and simple.
Say it!
Then don't say it.
There goes the neighbourhood.
Boone?
Looking for Boone?
Boone?
Boone!
Dammit, Boone.
No one here with that name.
Told you.
I know you.
He's talked about you.
Lori.
Pretty little butterfly.
N ice.
You're still a Natural.
- Wanna join the family?
- No!
You will.
Sooner or later,
you'll want to live forever.
No!
- OK, Decker, what have you got?
- I found Boone.
Somebody stole the corpse,
brought it down here?
There is no corpse.
He's not dead.
He was shot. Pumped full of bullets.
I saw it.
I saw it too, but he's alive.
He's killed again.
- I n Shere Neck?
- No. No, up in Midian.
Gentlemen.
Captain Eigerman.
I nspector Joyce,
Calgary Police Department.
This is Dr Decker.
And this is Shere Neck.
Midian is my jurisdiction.
Boone was my prisoner.
- We can work together.
- No we can't. I'll bring him in myself.
But he's not alone anymore.
I've heard that talk.
It's nuthouse talk.
- What talk?
- Midian.
Something is breeding there.
- U nderneath the cemetery.
- Bullshit.
- You believe that?
- Yes, I do.
And if somebody doesn't stop them,
there's gonna be a lot more bloodshed.
I promise.
Hey, you're very light on your feet.
You may not be gorgeous,
but you'll do for me.
U p and about already?
- J ust stay away from me.
- Hey, I'm sorry about upstairs,
but I see a pretty face
and I just have to kiss it.
- Hey, you can't go down there!
- Why not?
Isn't this a great place?
Shangri-La on dope. We love it!
- What's that smell?
- Not me.
The Berserkers are down there!
Mad bastards...
They'll rip orf your head
and shit down your neck!
- Did Boone go down there?
- And he won't be coming back.
- He's not dead?
- He's more than that.
If you don't believe me,
just wait until he comes to...
snirf a little blood!
That'll bring out the beast in him!
You can't go down there!
You need some beauty sleep.
Hey...
Love those tattoos.
Sailors.
Help me.
Get back here!
Come back!
Hey! Shine!
Slaughter! You missed!
- Where's Boone?
- This way.
Boone!
Don't look.
Don't look!
Come on!
Well, well,
guess he can't take the heat.
Thank God. Let's go.
I can't go out there.
I belong here.
Now, listen to me.
You belong with me.
That's why you lived.
That's why we both survived.
Because we belong together.
Don't you see they don't need you?
Nobody needs you but me.
- OK.
- OK?
I love you.
Come on.
There's no answer from the room.
I tried twice.
H uh? Oh.
Yeah, the key's still here.
I don't know,
I haven't seen them.
Arnie!
Hey, Arnie!
Where the fuck is he?
Arnie!
Listen, I'm gonna have to get
someone back to you on that...
OK.
Yeah.
Oh, shit.
Oh God, what a mess.
Gross me out.
Arnie?
OK, come on.
I'll get my sturf in two minutes.
- What's wrong?
- Why's it so empty?
Must be the rodeo.
I smell blood.
It's OK.
'Shere Neck Police. '
Boone! Next door...
It was Decker.
Decker did this.
Boone, what's wrong?
What is it?
I don't want you to see.
Get out!
Boone, I'm not gonna leave you!
Get in! Go! Go!
They're coming!
Go!
Freeze!
U p, up. up!
Get him up!
Christ, he stinks.
What are you looking at?
Move.
Captain?
You are a freak and a cannibal,
and you've come to the wrong town.
Get the door.
I'm gonna give you something
to remember me by.
Fucking cannibal.
Creep.
Put him in my custody right now!
- Still here, huh?
- I'm gonna go back to Midian with you.
Yeah...
I'll be right there.
Well, I'm not going anywhere with you,
I've got a press conference to deal with.
You tell him
I've got Boone under control.
Don't trust him.
- He changes.
- Sure he does.
Eigerman!
He was right about the motel.
- So what?
- So maybe there are others.
What are you talking about, monsters?
Killers. A cult. I don't know.
We should check it out.
- You wanna go out there?
- Yeah.
OK, we'll go out there.
- Pettine.
- Yo, Chief.
You and some of the boys take
I nspector Joyce here out to Midian.
When you get out there,
look around that graveyard.
You see anything with more
than two eyes, give me a holler.
I n the meantime I've got
a press conference. Goodbye.
Hey! Doctor's here
to examine you, freak.
J ust so no one can say
we laid one finger on you.
He looks OK to me.
What do you think, Doc?
No pulse.
- What's that?
- The man is dead.
What the hell are you trying
to do to me?
I don't understand what the hell's
going on around here!
Now, how many bullets did they pull
out of that geek up in Midian?
- Why?
- Why? You tell him why!
- I can't get a pulse on him.
- Jesus Christ!
- Are you saying he's dead?
- Not lying down dead, my friend.
Walkin' around in my fuckin' cell dead!
Now, what do you got to say
about that?
Can you hear me?
They'll find a way to kill you, Boone,
you know that?
Are you listening?
You're an abomination, Boone.
You have to die.
You hear me?
There's people down there.
I can feel it.
I suggest we call for backup.
Oh, shit!
Was that something?
I don't know,
maybe we're just all spooked.
Hell, who'd want
to live in a graveyard?
What do you say, I nspector?
Let's just call it a day.
No, no, no! Argh!
You want we should interrogate it,
I nspector?
- Give him some air.
- What the hell for?
Can't you see there's something
wrong with him?
- Help me, please!
- Get him orf me!
Get orf me!
- Jesus...
- Christ on a crutch.
He was just dust?
It was the sun.
The sun did it.
We've got the perfect weapon,
right over our heads.
Yeah...
J ust until it goes down.
Oh no. Shit! Pettine!
Goddammit, get out here!
Who did it?
Why did we have to get him back?
Maybe Baphomet told him something.
Something that could save Midian.
Pettine, what's your status?
They torched our car!
Lousy freaks!
Kane, get in here.
Yes, sir?
I think it's about time
we go out there, don't you?
Reverend Ashberry,
your services are required.
- He looks like a drunk.
- He is a drunk.
Lost his way,
the poor son of a bitch.
Now, you wouldn't want to miss
the J udgement Day, would you?
The Apocalypse?
- It's here?
- They're warming up for it over at Midian.
What I want you to do
is go over to your church
and get crosses,
and prayer books, and Bibles,
and whatever the hell else
you people use.
Cos we're going out there
with God on our side.
Whether it's Commies, freaks or Third World
Y-chromosome mutants, we are there.
Sons of the free.
Hey, freak-face, we found your pals.
And they're gonna fry,
just like you.
Hey, Constable Labowitz,
something to blow your brains?
- Beauties.
- All right!
Suck on that.
Hey, who's there?
What's the problem?
No problem!
Shit!
Somebody!
You all right, Coback?
Where is he?
Where's Boone?
Cell 3, through the door.
I love a coward!
Don't think you're
getting sprung, freak!
No way they get through that door,
it's solid steel!
You hear me, freak?
Jesus Christ!
Ray!
I do not want to hurt you.
Naughty, naughty!
I want you to wait out here.
Brave girl.
I'm not afraid of you.
I don't wanna be dust.
I wanna splash in the water.
No time for hoochie-coochie.
Are we going?
Did you ever perform
an exorcism, Preacher?
- No.
- I suggest you start rehearsing.
Better take one of these.
I wouldn't know what to do with it.
"So Moses spoke to the people saying,
'Arm yourselves for war,
"'and let them go and take vengeance
for the Lord... on Midian. '
"And so they burned with fire
all the cities where they dwelt
"and killed the kings of Midian,
both man and beast."
Ooh, Doc, it sounds like we're going
head-to-head with the Devil himself.
- I don't believe in the Devil.
- Oh, but you will.
Hot damn!
Woo!
All right, let's move in.
Only a mile or two more.
- There's a shortcut near here.
- Where?
Now!
Let's go! Let's go!
Move it! Move it, move it!
What are you doing here, Decker?
You'll miss all the fun.
I just... I just found something in there
I really think you ought to take a look at.
What the hell is this, Decker?
Minus ten seconds.
Five... four... three...
two... one...
We are too late.
Looks like the millennium
just ended.
Die, you fucker!
Bastards.
- Rachel!
- Babette!
- Rachel!
- Babette?
Babette!
Stay down.
This is our home.
We belong here.
Stay where you are!
- They're waiting for us above!
- No!
Don't listen to him
or we'll all be slaughtered.
If you want to live, it won't be here.
And it won't be by your laws.
Now, if we want to survive,
we can't hide.
Brothers and sisters, it is time to fight.
Outstanding!
Come on!
- Don't look down.
- Come on, hurry! H urry!
Women and children upstairs.
- You heard what he said.
- What chance have we got?
- They're armed.
- So am I.
Come to Daddy.
Babette...
Come on. Come on.
Hey! My lucky day!
Come on, she's just a kid!
You found her.
Look what we got here.
Say goodnight.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid. It's all right.
Which way's safe?
You've got to stop!
There are children down there.
You're killing children!
Go ahead, faggot.
Don't!
- Sorry, Padre.
- Eigerman!
Get up!
We don't like priests here.
Ow!
What the fuck is this?
I don't feel so good.
Kane!
What in the hell are you doing down here?
Your people need you!
Baphomet is going to destroy us all.
The Naturals, the Breed, Midian.
Everything!
- How do you know?
- Take a look for yourself.
The whole place is gonna blow?
- It's Baphomet's will.
- Look, we can make it out.
- But we need fighters.
- We're not warriors.
- What about the Berserkers?
- Madness, they're uncontrollable.
Better yet! Let them out.
We are the Tribes of the Moon.
You said so.
The Tribes of the Moon.
I'll release them.
What's the plan?
The usual.
You take the big guy.
Sucker!
You don't want to do that.
- Gimme a good reason why not.
- I'll give you two.
Eurgh! What a mess.
My God!
What have you done?
Yo! Moses!
Watch the pretty light.
Wait for it...
Here it comes.
Oh, shit!
Go get 'em, boys!
Die!
Holy shit!
Stop!
You goddamn cowards!
I'll kill you all!
Gibbs! Gimme a weapon!
Lori.
I didn't believe
in the prophecies.
It's all over.
What prophecies?
You want to see?
- That's Boone.
- Yes, it's him.
All these years
waiting for a saviour.
He hasn't saved us.
He's destroyed us.
I made him.
The bite... was mine.
- The bite that mocks death.
- That doesn't make him yours.
Quite a dance, huh?
Death everywhere
and you and me in the middle.
Come on!
Come on!
Boone!
Not yet.
One last dance?
Boone!
Oh, my God.
Decker's dead.
Pull the knife out.
No!
Don't go.
I have to.
I'm responsible.
You have destroyed our refuge.
This was inevitable.
No home is forever.
You must rebuild what you've destroyed.
You must find me, heal me,
save me from my enemies.
You are no longer Boone.
You are Cabal.
Save me from my enemies.
Save me from my enemies.
N ight-night, sweetheart.
- Where will I find you when I need you?
- You'll find me.
And you'll need me.
Never touched a legend before.
I saw their god, Master.
He burned me.
I want to burn him back!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
# This is someone else's soul
# Someone that I never knew
# This is someone else's body
# Am I getting through to you
# if you peel away the orange
# There's something underneath
# if you look below for hidden treasures
# U nderneath another layer
# Are you hiding underneath the sea #
