Our pasta this evening is
squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth
with goat cheese profiteroles,
and I also have
an arugula Caesar salad.
For entrées this evening,
I have swordfish meatloaf
with onion marmalade,
rare-roasted partridge breast
in raspberry coulis
with a sorrel timbale...
And grilled free-range rabbit
with herbed French fries.
Our pasta tonight is a squid
ravioli in a lemon grass broth,
and the fish tonight
is grilled...
With a double espresso.
God, I hate this place.
It's a chicks' restaurant.
Why aren't we at Dorsia?
Because Bateman won't
give the maître d'head.
Is that Reed Robinson over there?
Are you freebasing or what?
That's not Robinson.
Well, who is it, then?
It's Paul Allen.
That's not Paul Allen.
Paul Allen's on the other
side of the room. Over there.
Who's he with?
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.
They don't have a good
bathroom to do coke in.
Are you sure
that's Paul Allen over there?
Yes, McDufus, I am.
He's handling
the Fisher account.
Lucky bastard.
Lucky Jew bastard.
Jesus, McDermott, what does
that have to do with anything?
I've seen that bastard
sitting in his office,
talking on the phone to the
CEO, spinning a fucking menorah.
Not a menorah.
You spin a dreidel.
Oh, my God, Bateman.
You want me to fry you up some
fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?
No, just cool it
with the anti-Semitic remarks.
Oh, I'd forgotten. Bateman's
dating someone from the ACLU.
He's the voice of reason.
The boy next door.
Speaking of reasonable.
Only $570.
Not bad.
A little something
for the purse.
Give her the $50.
Two Stolis on the rocks.
These aren't good any more.
It's a cash bar.
That'll be $25.
You're a fucking ugly bitch.
I want to stab you to death,
then play around
with your blood.
What can I get for you two?
I live in
the American Gardens building
on West 81st Street,
on the 11th floor.
My name is Patrick Bateman.
I'm 27 years old.
I believe in
taking care of myself
and a balanced diet
and a rigorous
exercise routine.
In the morning,
if my face is a little puffy,
I'll put on an ice pack while
doing my stomach crunches.
I can do 1,000 now.
After I remove the ice pack, I
use a deep-pore cleanser lotion.
In the shower, I use a
water-activated gel cleanser,
then a honey-almond
body scrub,
and on the face,
an exfoliating gel scrub.
Then I apply
an herb mint facial mask,
which I leave on
for 10 minutes,
while I prepare
the rest of my routine.
I always use
an aftershave lotion
with little or no alcohol,
because alcohol
dries your face out
and makes you look older.
Then moisturizer,
then an anti-ageing eye balm
followed by a final
moisturizing protective lotion.
There is an idea of
a Patrick Bateman,
some kind of abstraction,
but there is no real me,
only an entity,
something illusory.
And though I can hide
my cold gaze
and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours,
and maybe you can even sense our
lifestyles are probably comparable,
I simply am not there.

- When?
- After 6:00.
Negative. Cancel it.
And what should I say?
Just say no.
Just say no?
Okay, Jean, I need reservations
for three at Camols at 12:30,
and if not there,
try Crayons, all right?
Yes, sir.
Oh, wait, and I need
reservations for two
at Arcadia at
8:00 on Thursday.
Something romantic?
No.
Silly.
Forget it, I'll make them.
- No, I'll do it.
- No, no.
Be a doll and just get me
a mineral water, okay?
You look nice today.
Don't wear
that outfit again.
What? I didn't hear you.
I said, do not wear
that outfit again.
Wear a dress,
a skirt or something.
You don't like this,
I take it?
Come on,
you're prettier than that.
Thanks, Patrick.
I'm not here.
And high heels.
I like high heels.

Williams party.
I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace,
since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.
But we do,
and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.
Patrick, this is my cousin
Vanden and her boyfriend Stash.
They're both artists.
The menu's in Braille.
I see you've met everyone.
You look awesome.
Okay, okay, all right.
I'm fairly certain that Timothy
Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair.
Timothy is the only
interesting person I know.
I'm almost
completely indifferent
as to whether Evelyn knows
I'm having an affair
with Courtney Rawlinson,
her closest friend.
Courtney is almost
perfect-looking.
She's usually operating on
one or more psychiatric drugs.
Tonight, I believe it's Xanax.
More disturbing than
her drug use, though,
is the fact
that she's engaged
to Luis Carruthers, the
biggest dufus in the business.
Tell me, Stash,
do you think Soho is becoming
too commercial?
Yes, I read that.
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?
Hey, that affects us.
Oh. Well what about the
massacres in Sri Lanka, honey?
Doesn't that affect us, too?
I mean, do you know anything
about Sri Lanka?
How, like,
the Sikhs are killing, like,
tons of Israelis over there?
Come on, Bryce.
There are a lot more important
problems than Sri Lanka to worry about.
Like what?
Well, we have to
end apartheid, for one,
and slow down
the nuclear arms race,
stop terrorism,
and world hunger.
We have to provide food
and shelter for the homeless
and oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights
while also promoting
equal rights for women.
We have to encourage a return
to traditional moral values.
Most importantly,
we have to promote
general social concern
and less materialism
in young people.
Patrick,
how thought-provoking.
Hello.
Hello.
"Bleach-ee"? Are you
trying to say "bleach-ee"?
Oh, my God. Two things.
One, you can't bleach a
Cerruti. Out of the question.
Two, I can only get
these sheets in Santa Fe.
These are very expensive sheets
and I really need them clean.
If you don't shut
your fucking mouth,
I will kill you.
I have a lunch meeting at Hubert's
in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison
and I need those sheets
cleaned by this afternoon.
Listen,
I cannot understand you!
This is crazy.
You're a fool.
I can't cope with this.
Stupid "bitch-ee"!
Understand? Christ.
Patrick?
Hi, Patrick.
I thought that was you.
Hello...
Isn't it ridiculous coming
all the way up here?
But they really are
the best.
Then why can't they get
these stains out?
I mean, can you talk
to these people or something?
I'm not getting anywhere.
Oh, what are those?
Oh, well, it's cranberry
juice. Cran-apple.
Really?
Listen, if you could talk to
them, I would really appreciate it.
I'm really late. I have a lunch
appointment at Hubert's in 15 minutes.
Hubert's?
That moved uptown, right?
Well, boy, listen,
I've gotta go.
Thank you, Victoria.
Maybe we could do lunch
one day next week.
You know, I'm downtown...
I don't know, Victoria,
I'm at work all the time.
What about a Saturday?
- Next Saturday?
- Sure.
Can't, I'm afraid.
I have a matinée of Les Mis.
Listen, I've really got to go.
Christ. I'll call you.
Okay. Do.
Listen, you're dating Luis.
He's in Arizona.
You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans.
What could you possibly
be up to tonight?
Stop it. I'm...
On a lot of lithium?
Waiting for Luis to call me.
He said he'd call tonight.
Pumpkin.
Pumpkin,
you're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin, you're dating the
biggest dickweed in New York.
Pumpkin, you're dating
a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick, stop
calling me pumpkin, okay?
I have to go.
Courtney!
Dinner.
I can't!
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Wear something fabulous.
Dorsia.
Yes, I know
it's a little late,
but is it possible to reserve a table
for two at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing,
and then to the Pottery Barn
where I got this
little silver muffin dish.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
God, Patrick, shut up.
Courtney, you should take some
more lithium or have a Diet Coke.
Some caffeine might
get you out of this slump.
I just want a child.
Just two
perfect
children.
Are we here?
Yeah.
This is Dorsia?
- Yes, dear.
- Good evening.
Courtney, you're gonna have
the peanut butter soup
with smoked duck
and mashed squash.
New York Matinee called it
"a playful,
but mysterious little dish".
You'll love it.
And then the red snapper
with violets and pine nuts.
I think
that will follow nicely.
Thanks, Patrick.
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.
Dorsia, how impressive.
How on earth did you get
a reservation there?
Lucky, I guess.
That's a wonderful suit.
Don't tell me, don't
tell me, let me guess.
Valentino Couture.
It looks so soft.
Your compliment
was sufficient, Luis.
Hello, Halberstram.
Nice tie.
How the hell are you?
Allen has mistaken me for
this dickhead, Marcus Halberstram.
It seems logical, because
Marcus also works at P&P
and, in fact, does
the same exact thing I do.
He also has a penchant for Valentino
suits and Oliver Peoples glasses.
Marcus and I even go
to the same barber,
although I have
a slightly better haircut.
So how's the Ransom
account going, Marcus?
- It's all right.
- Really?
That's interesting.
It's not... It's not great.
Oh, well, you know.
So how's Cecilia?
She's a great girl.
Oh, yeah, I'm very lucky.
Hey, Allen.
Congratulations on
the Fisher account.
Thank you, Baxter.
Listen, Paul. Squash?
Call me.
- How about Friday?
- No can do.
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.
Great sea urchin ceviche.
Dorsia on a Friday night?
How'd he swing that?
I think he's lying.
Is that a gram?
New card.
What do you think?
Very nice.
Look at that.
Picked them up
from the printer's yesterday.
Good colouring.
That's bone.
And the lettering is
something called Silian Rail.
It's very cool, Bateman.
But that's nothing.
Look at this.
That is really nice.
Eggshell with Romalian type.
What do you think?
Nice.
Jesus.
That is really super.
How did a nitwit like
you get so tasteful?
I can't believe
that Bryce prefers
Van Patten's card to mine.
But wait.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Raised lettering.
Pale Nimbus White.
Impressive. Very nice.
Let's see Paul Allen's card.
Look at that subtle
off-white colouring,
the tasteful thickness of it.
Oh, my God.
It even has a watermark.
Is something wrong,
Patrick?
You're sweating.
Hello.
Pat Bateman.
You want some money?
Some food?
This what you need?
I'm hungry.
Yeah. Cold out, too,
isn't it?
Why don't you get a job?
If you're so hungry,
why don't you get a job?
I lost my job.
Why? You drinking?
Is that why you lost it?
Insider trading?
Just joking.
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
- Al.
- Get a goddamn job, Al.
You got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you.
You gotta
get your act together.
I'll help you.
You are so kind, mister.
You're kind.
You're a kind man.
- It's okay.
- I can tell.
Please, you gotta tell me what to do.
You gotta help me.
I'm so cold.
I'm hungry.
You know how bad you smell?
You reek of shit.
Do you know that?
Al.
I'm sorry.
It's just that...
I don't know.
I don't have
anything in common with you.
Oh, thank you, mister.
Thank you.
I'm cold out here.
You know
what a fucking loser you are?
What?
What beautiful skin
you have, Mr Bateman.
So fine, so smooth.
I have all the
characteristics of a human being,
flesh, blood, skin, hair,
but not a single clear
identifiable emotion,
except for greed and disgust.
Something horrible
is happening inside of me,
and I don't know why.
My nightly blood lust
has overflowed into my days.
I feel lethal,
on the verge of frenzy.
I think my mask of sanity
is about to slip.
Hey, MacLoy,
what do you say?
Hey, Hamilton,
have a holly, jolly Christmas.
Is Allen still handling
the Fisher account?
Of course. Who else?
Mistletoe alert.
Merry Xmas, Patrick.
Merry Xmas, Harry.
Merry Christmas.
You're late, honey.
I'm not late.
Oh, yes, you are.
I've been here
the entire time.
You just didn't see me.
Say hello to Snowball.
Snowball says
"Merry Christmas, Patrick".
What is it?
It's a little baby
piggy-wiggy, isn't it?
It's a Vietnamese
potbellied pig.
They make darling pets.
Don't you?
Don't you?
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a Grinch.
What does Mr Grinch
want for Christmas?
And don't say
"breast implants" again.
Allen.
Marcus! Merry Christmas.
How you been?
Workaholic, I suppose?
I haven't seen you
in a while.
Hey, Hamilton! We're going
to Nell's. Limo's out front.
We should have dinner.
Maybe you could bring...
Cecilia?
Yes, Cecilia!
Oh, Cecilia would adore it.
Well, then
let's do it, Marcus.
Great party.
Thanks.
Patrick,
why is he calling you Marcus?
Mistletoe alert.
Marcus Halberstram
for two at 7:00.
No, I want to know.
I came here for the cilantro
crawfish gumbo. All right?
Which is, after all, the only excuse one
could have for being in this restaurant,
which is, by the way,
almost completely empty.
I'm very sorry, sir.
J&B straight and a Corona.
Would you like to hear...
Double Absolut martini.
Yes, sir.
Would you like
to hear the specials?
Not if you want
to keep your spleen.
This is a real beehive
of activity, Halberstram.
This place is hot.
Very hot.
Listen, the mud soup and charcoal
arugula are outrageous here.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce.
Give me a break.
I see they've omitted the
pork loin with lime Jell-O.
We should've gone to Dorsia.
I could have
gotten us a table.
Nobody goes there any more.
Is that Ivana Trump?
Oh, jeez, Patrick...
I mean, Marcus,
what are you thinking?
Why would Ivana
be at Texarkana?
So, wasn't Rothschild originally
handling the Fisher account?
How'd you get it?
Well, I could tell you that,
Halberstram,
but then I'd have
to kill you.
I like to dissect girls.
Did you know
I'm utterly insane?
Great tan, Marcus.
Really impressive.
- Where do you tan?
- Salon.
I've got a tanning bed
at home.
You should look into it.
And Cecilia... How is she?
Where is she tonight?
Cecilia is...
Well, you know Cecilia.
I think she's having dinner
with Evelyn Williams.
Evelyn! Great ass.
Goes out with that loser
Patrick Bateman.
What a dork.
Another martini, Paul?
You like
Huey Lewis and the News?
They're okay.
Their early work was a little
too new wave for my taste.
But when Sports
came out in '83,
I think they really came into their
own, commercially and artistically.
The whole album has a clear,
crisp sound
and a new sheen
of consummate professionalism
that really gives the songs
a big boost.
He's been compared
to Elvis Costello,
but I think Huey has a far more
bitter, cynical sense of humour.
Hey, Halberstram.
Yes, Allen?
Why are there copies of the
Style section all over the place?
Do you have a dog?
A little chow or something?
No, Allen.
Is that a raincoat?
Yes, it is!
In '87, Huey released this,
Fore!,
their most accomplished album.
I think their undisputed
masterpiece is Hip to Be Square.
The song's so catchy. Most people
probably don't listen to the lyrics.
But they should because it's not
just about the pleasures of conformity
and the importance of trends, it's also a
personal statement about the band itself.

Is that you?
No, Luis, it's not me.
You're mistaken.
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.
Where are you going?
We're going to Nell's.
Gwendolyn's father
is buying it.
Where did you get
that overnight bag?
Jean Paul Gaultier.
When I get
to Paul Allen's place,
I use the keys I took from his
pocket before disposing of the body.
There is a moment
of sheer panic
when I realize that Paul's
apartment overlooks the park
and it's obviously
more expensive than mine.
I calm myself
and move into the bedroom,
where I find his suitcase
and start to pack.
It's time for Paul
to take a little trip.
Where to send the bastard?
Dallas?
Paris? Singapore?
London.
I'll send the ass to London.
Hi, this is Paul.
I've been called away
to London for a few days.
Meredith, I'll call you
when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.

Yes, Jean?
There's a Mr Donald Kimball
here to see you.
Who?
Detective Donald Kimball.
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows
you're here.
Send him in, I guess.
Now, John,
you've gotta wear clothes
in proportion
to your physique.
There are definite
dos and don'ts, good buddy,
of wearing
a bold-striped shirt.
A bold-striped shirt calls
for solid-coloured
or discretely patterned
suits and ties.
Yes,
always tip the stylist 15%.
Listen, John, I've got to go.
T. Boone Pickens
just walked in.
Just joking.
No, don't tip
the owner of the salon.
Okay, John. Right. Got it.
Sorry about that.
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made
an appointment.
Was that anything important?
Oh, that? Just mulling
over business problems,
examining opportunities,
exchanging rumours,
spreading gossip.
Hi. I'm Donald Kimball.
Hi, Pat Bateman.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry to barge in
on you like this.
I know how busy
you guys can get.
So, what's
the topic of discussion?
I've been hired
by Meredith Powell
to investigate the
disappearance of Paul Allen.
I see, yeah.
Paul's disappearance, yeah.
So it's nothing
that official.
I just have some basic
questions about Paul Allen.
- About yourself...
- Coffee?
No, I'm okay.
- Apollinaris?
- No, I'm okay.
- Can you bring Mister...
- Kimball.
Mr Kimball a bottle of Apol...
No, really, I'm okay.
It's no problem.
So, what's
the topic of discussion?
The disappearance
of Paul Allen.
Right.
Well, I haven't...
I haven't heard anything about
the disappearance or anything,
not on Page Six at least.
I think his family wants
this kept quiet.
Understandable. Lime?
No, really, I'm okay.
You sure?
I can always get you a lime.
Just some preliminary questions
that I need for my own files, okay?
Shoot.
How old are you?
27.
Where did you go to school?
Harvard.
Then Harvard Business School.
Your address?
The American Gardens building,
West 81st Street.
Nice. Very nice.
Thanks.
What can you tell me
about Paul Allen?
I'm at a loss.
He was part of
that whole Yale thing.
"Yale thing"?
Yeah, Yale thing.
What do you mean,
"Yale thing"?
Well, I think for one that he
was probably a closet homosexual
who did a lot of cocaine.
That Yale thing.
What kind of man was he?
Besides the information
you've just given me.
I hope I'm not being
cross-examined here.
Do you feel like that?
No, not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang out?
Yeah, you know, hang out.
Let me think. The Newport.
Harry's. Flutie's.
Indochine. Nell's.
The Cornell Club.
The New York Yacht Club.
He had a yacht?
No, he just hung out there.
And where did he go
to school?
Don't you know this?
I just wanted to know
if you know.
Before Yale, if I remember
correctly, Saint Paul's.
Listen, I just...
I just want to help.
I understand.
Do you have any witnesses
or fingerprints?
Well, there's a message
on his answering machine
that says he went to London.
Maybe he did, huh?
His girlfriend
doesn't think so.
But has anyone
seen him in London?
Actually, yes.
But I've had a hard time
getting actual verification.
A Stephen Hughes said he saw
him at a restaurant there.
But I checked it out,
and what happened is
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth
for Paul, so...
Had his apartment
been burglarized?
No, actually it hadn't.
Toiletries were missing,
a suit was gone,
so was some luggage,
that's it.
I mean, no one's dealing with the
homicide squad yet, or anything, right?
No, not yet.
As I said, we're not sure.
Basically, no one's
seen or heard anything.
So typical, isn't it?
It's just strange.
One day
someone's walking around,
going to work, alive,
and then...
Nothing.
People just disappear.
The earth just opens up
and swallows them.
Eerie. Really eerie.
Listen,
you'll have to excuse me.
I have a lunch meeting
with Cliff Huxtable
at The Four Seasons
in 20 minutes.
The Four Seasons?
Isn't that
a little far uptown?
I mean,
aren't you gonna be late?
No, there's one down here.
Oh, really?
I didn't know that.
Yes. It's very good.
Listen, if anything else occurs
to you, any information...
Absolutely.
I'm 100% with you.
Great, and thanks
for your time, Mr Bateman.
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.
I haven't seen you
around here.
You just haven't been looking.
Would you like
to see my apartment?
I'm not supposed to.
Do you want to come
to my apartment or not?
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.
Would you take
a credit card?
I'm joking.
Come on, get in.
I'd like a girl,
early twenties, blonde,
who does couples. Couples.
And I really can't stress
"blonde" enough. Blonde.
I'm Paul.
My name's Paul Allen.
You got that?
You're Christie.
You're to respond
only to Christie.
Is that clear?
If you don't know me
by now
You will never never
never know me
That's a very fine chardonnay
you're drinking.
I want you to clean
your vagina.
If you don't know me by now
You will never never
never know me
No. From behind.
Get on your knees.
You have a very nice body.
Thank you. Send her up.
Christie, get out
and dry off,
choose a robe, not the Bijan,
and come and meet me and our guest
in the living room for drinks.
You've arrived! How lovely.
Let me take your coat.
I'm Paul.
How good of you to come.
Not quite blonde, are you?
More dirty blonde.
I'm gonna call you Sabrina.
I'm Paul Allen.
So,
don't you want
to know what I do?
No.
No, not really.
Well, I work on Wall Street
at Pierce & Pierce.
Have you heard of it?
You have a really
nice place here, Paul.
How much did you
pay for it?
Well, actually, that's none
of your business, Christie.
But I can assure you,
it certainly wasn't cheap.
No. No smoking.
Not in here.
Varda truffle?
I don't want
you to get drunk,
but that's a very fine
chardonnay you're not drinking.
Do you like Phil Collins?
I've been a big Genesis fan
ever since the release
of their 1980 album, Duke.
Before that, I really didn't
understand any of their work.
It was too artsy.
Too intellectual.
It was on Duke where
Phil Collins' presence
became more apparent.
I think Invisible Touch
is the group's
undisputed masterpiece.
It's an epic meditation
on intangibility.
At the same time,
it deepens and enriches
the meaning
of the preceding three albums.
Christie, take off the robe.
Listen to
the brilliant ensemble playing
of Banks, Collins,
and Rutherford.
You can practically hear every
nuance of every instrument.
Sabrina, remove your dress.
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer songwriting,
this album hits
a new peak of professionalism.
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?
Take the lyrics to
Land of Confusion.
In this song, Phil Collins
addresses the problems
of abusive
political authority.
In Too Deep is the most
moving pop song of the 1980s,
about monogamy
and commitment.
The song is
extremely uplifting.
Their lyrics are
as positive and affirmative
as anything
I've heard in rock.
Christie,
get down on your knees
so Sabrina can
see your asshole.
Phil Collins' solo career
seems to be more commercial,
and therefore more satisfying
in a narrower way.
Especially songs like In The
Air Tonight and Against All Odds.
Sabrina, don't just
stare at it. Eat it.
But I also think
Phil Collins works best
within the confines of the
group than as a solo artist.
And I stress
the word "artist".
This is Sussudio.
A great, great song.
A personal favourite.
Look at the camera.
♪ There's this girl
that's been on my mind
♪ All the time
♪ Sussudio
♪ Now she don't even
know my name
♪ But I think
she likes me just the same
♪ Sussudio
♪ Oh, if she called me
I'd be there
♪ I'd come running anywhere
Christie, look at the camera.
♪ She's all I need all my life
♪ I feel so good
if I just say the word
♪ Sussudio
Don't touch the watch.
Can we go now?
We're not through yet.
If they have a good personality
and they're not great-looking,
then who fucking cares?
Well let's just say,
hypothetically, okay,
what if they have
a good personality?
I know, I know.
There are no girls
with good personalities.
A good personality consists of
a chick with a little hard body
who'll satisfy
all sexual demands
without being
too slutty about things
and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth shut.
The only girls with good
personalities who are smart,
or maybe funny or halfway
intelligent or talented,
though God knows what the fuck
that means, are ugly chicks.
Absolutely.
And this is because
they have to make up
for how fucking unattractive
they are.
You know what Ed Gein
said about women?
Ed Gein?
Maître d'at Canal Bar?
No. Serial killer.
Wisconsin, in the '50s.
What did Ed say?
He said, "When I see a pretty
girl walking down the street,
I think two things. One part
of me wants to take her out
and talk to her, be real nice
and sweet and treat her right."
And what did
the other part of him think?
What her head
would look like on a stick.
Hi, guys.
I want to get
your opinion on something.
It's my business card.
I decided to get
a new one, too.
Oh, that's...
Very nice, Luis.
Thank you.
Listen, what about dinner?
Is that all you ever have to contribute,
Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
Cheer up there, Bateman. What's
the matter, no shiatsu this morning?
Keep touching me like that,
and you'll draw back a stump.
Hold on there, little buddy.
Excuse me.
God. Patrick. Why here?
I've seen you looking at me.
I've noticed your hot body.
Don't be shy.
You can't imagine
how long I've wanted this,
ever since that Christmas
party at Arizona 206.
You know the one, you were wearing
that red striped paisley Armani tie.
I want you.
I want you, too.
- Patrick.
- What is it?
Where are you going?
I've gotta return
some videotapes.
Patrick!
Okay, Monday?
The 20th.
Monday? That's...
Any Paul Allen?
Reservation, no.
No reservation, but...
Kimball. I've been wanting
to talk with you.
Come into my office.
Jean, great jacket.
Matsuda?
Do you remember where you were
the night of Paul's disappearance,
which was on
the 20th of December?
God.
I guess I was probably
returning videotapes.
I had a date with
a girl named Veronica.
That's not what I've got.
What?
That's not the information
I've received.
Well, wait.
What information
have you received?
Let me see.
You were with...
Well, I could be wrong.
When was the last time
you were with Paul Allen?
We'd gone to
a new musical called...
O Africa, Brave Africa.
It was a laugh riot.
That was about it.
I think we had dinner
at Orso's.
No, Petal...
No, Orso's.
I hope I've been informative.
Long day. Bit scattered.
I'm a little spent now, too.
But how about lunch
in a week or so,
when I've sorted out
all this information?
Great. Yes, I'd like that.
And if you could try
and pin down where you were
the night of Paul Allen's
disappearance,
it would make my job
a lot easier.
Absolutely.
I'm with you on that one.
Huey Lewis and the News.
Great stuff. I just bought it
on my way here. You heard it?
Never.
I mean,
I don't really like singers.
Not a big music fan, huh?
No, I like music.
Just they're...
Huey's too black-sounding
for me.
To each his own.
So, lunch next week?
I'll be there.
Will you call me
before Easter?
Maybe.
What are you doing tonight?
Dinner at River Café.
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.
I never knew you smoked.
You never noticed.
Listen, Patrick,
can we talk?
You look marvellous.
There's nothing to say.
You're gonna marry Luis.
Isn't that special?
Patrick?
Yes, Courtney?
If I don't see you before
Easter, have a nice one, okay?
You, too.
Patrick?
Yeah?
Nothing.
There's this theory now
that if you can catch the AIDS virus
through having sex with someone,
then you can catch anything.
Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy,
haemophilia, leukaemia,
diabetes, dyslexia.
I'm not sure, but I don't
think dyslexia's a virus.
Who knows? They don't
know that. Prove it.
Oh, God!
What?
It's a fucking milligram
of sweetener.
I wanna get high off this,
not sprinkle it
on my fucking oatmeal.
It's definitely weak,
but I have a feeling
if we do enough of it,
we'll be okay.
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to do drugs!
Fuck you!
Calm down.
Do it anyway.
That's right.
That is, if the faggot
in the next stall
thinks it's okay!
- Hey, fuck you!
- Fuck you!
Sorry, dude.
The steroids.
Okay, let's do it.
Where did Craig go?
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.
McDermott went
to sign a peace treaty
between the United States
and Russia.
He's the one behind glasnost.
He said he was
in mergers and acquisitions.
You're not confused,
are you?
No, not really.
Gorbachev is not downstairs.
Caron's right.
Gorbachev's not downstairs.
He's at Tunnel.
Ask me a question.
So, what do you do?
I'm into murders
and executions, mostly.
Do you like it?
Well, it depends. Why?
Well, most guys I know
who work in mergers and
acquisitions really don't like it.
So, where do you work out?
You think I'm dumb,
don't you?
What?
You think I'm dumb.
You think all models are dumb.
No. I really don't.
That's okay. I don't mind.
There's something sweet
about you.
Doing the crossword?
You need any help?
Jean?
Yes, Patrick?
Would you like
to accompany me to dinner?
That is,
if you're not doing anything.
No, no, I don't have any plans.
Well.
Isn't this a coincidence?
Listen, where should we go?
Anywhere you want.
Let's not think
about what I want.
How about anywhere you want?
I don't know, Patrick.
I can't make this decision.
Come on.
Where do you want to go?
Anywhere you want.
Just say it.
I can get us in anywhere.
What about...
Dorsia?
So,
Dorsia is where
Jean wants to go.
I don't know.
No, we'll go
wherever you want to go.
Dorsia is fine.
Dorsia. Yes?
Yeah, can you take two tonight
at, well, let's say 9:00?
We're totally booked.
Really? That's great.
No, I said
we are totally booked.
Two at 9:00? Perfect.
See you then.
Yeah.
You're
dressed okay.
You didn't give a name.
They know me.
Why don't you meet me at my
place at 7:00, for drinks.
And, Jean?
You'll want to change
before we go out.
Patrick, it's so elegant.
What a wonderful view.
Jean?
Sorbet?
Thanks, Patrick.
I'd love some.
Do you want a bite?
I'm on a diet.
But thank you.
You don't need
to lose any weight.
You're kidding, right?
You look great. Very fit.
You can always be thinner,
look better.
Well, maybe we shouldn't
go out to dinner.
I don't want
to ruin your willpower.
No, it's all right.
I'm not very good at
controlling it anyway.
So, listen,
what do you really want
to do with your life?
Just briefly. Summarize.
And don't tell me you enjoy
working with children, okay?
Well, I'd like to travel
and maybe go back to school,
but I don't really know.
I'm at a point in my life where there
seems to be so many possibilities.
But I don't know.
I'm just so unsure.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No, not really.
Interesting.
Are you seeing anyone?
I mean, seriously?
Maybe.
I don't know.
Not really.
Jean,
do you feel fulfilled?
I mean, in your life?
I guess I do. For a long time,
I was too focused on my work.
But now I've really begun to
think about changing myself.
You know,
developing and growing.
Growing.
I'm glad you said that.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's
first dog, a collie,
was named Lassie?
Had you heard this?
Who's Ted Bundy?
Forget it.
What's that?
Duct tape. I need it for
taping something.
Patrick?
Have you ever wanted
to make someone happy?
What?
No! Put it in the carton!
Sorry.
Jean?
What?
Make someone happy.
Have you ever wanted to?
I'm looking for...
I guess you could say
I just want to have
a meaningful relationship
with someone special.
Patrick. Patrick.
I know you're there.
Pick up the phone,
you bad boy.
What are you up to tonight?
It's me. Don't try to hide.
I hope you're not out there with
some little number you picked up,
because you're mine,
Mr Bateman.
My boy next door.
Anyway, you never called me,
and you said you would.
And I'll leave a message for Jean
about this, too, to remind you,
but we're having dinner
with Melania and Taylor.
You know Melania.
She went to Sweet Briar.
And we're meeting
at the Cornell Club,
so I'll call you
tomorrow morning, honey.
Oh. Sorry.
I know you hate that.
Bye, Patrick.
Bye, Mr Big-time CEO.
Bye-bye.
Was that Evelyn?
Are you still seeing her?
I'm sorry.
I have no right to ask that.
Do you want me to go?
Yeah.
I don't think
I can control myself.
I know. I should go.
I know I have a tendency to get
involved with unavailable men.
I mean,
do you want me to go?
I think if you stay,
something bad will happen.
I think I might hurt you.
You don't want
to get hurt, do you?
No. No, I guess not.
I don't want to get bruised.
You're right. I should go.
Don't forget you have
a lunch date tomorrow
with Donald Kimball
at Smith and Wollensky.
Thanks.
It slipped
my mind completely.
So, the night
he disappeared,
any new thoughts
about what you did?
Not sure. I had a shower
and some sorbet.
I think you're getting
your dates mixed up.
Well, where do you place
Paul that night?
According to his date book, and
this was verified by his secretary,
he had dinner with
Marcus Halberstram.
- And?
- I questioned him.
- Marcus.
- Yes, and he denies it.
Though, at first,
he couldn't be sure.
But he denied it?
Yes.
Well,
does Marcus have an alibi?
Yes.
He does? You're sure?
I've checked it out.
It's clean.
Now, where were you?
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Allen.
Who was he with?
He was at Atlantis
with Craig McDermott,
Frederick Dibble,
Harry Newman, George Butner,
and you.
Oh, right, yeah.
Of course.
He had wanted
Paul Allen to come,
but he had made plans,
and I guess I had dinner with
Victoria the following night.
Personally, I think
the guy went a little nutso,
split town for a while.
Maybe he did go to London,
sightseeing, drinking, whatever.
Anyway, I'm pretty sure
he'll turn up sooner or later.
I mean, to think that one
of his friends killed him
for no reason whatsoever
would be too ridiculous.
Isn't that right, Patrick?
Christie. Christie!
I'm not so sure about this.
I had to go to Emergency
after last time.
This won't be anything
like last time. I promise.
I don't think so.
Just come in the limo
and talk to me for a minute.
The driver's here.
You're safe.
Nothing like last time.
I promise.
All right.
So, you're looking great.
How've you been?
Well, I actually might need a
little surgery after last time.
Really?
My friend told me I should
maybe even get a lawyer.
Lawyers are so complicated.
Don't do that.
Here's a cheque.
Half now, half later.
Okay. Your name's Christie.
We're meeting
a friend of mine, Elizabeth.
She'll be joining us
in my new apartment shortly.
You'll like her.
She's a very nice girl.
You look really familiar.
Did you go to Dalton?
I think I met you at the Surf
Bar, didn't I? With Spicey?
Well, maybe not with Spicey,
but definitely at Surf Bar.
You know, Surf Bar?
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now.
It's terrible.
Went to a birthday party there for
Malcolm Forbes. Oh, my God, please.
This is nicer
than your other apartment.
Well, it's not that nice.
Where did you two meet?
Oh, God. We met at...
Oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby
in '85 or '86.
You were hanging out with that
bimbo Allison Poole. Hot number.
What do you mean?
She was a hot number.
If you had a platinum card,
she'd give you a blow job.
Listen, this girl worked at a
tanning salon. Need I say more?
What do you do?
She's my
cousin.
She's from
France.
Where's your phone?
I've gotta call Harley.
Where do you summer?
Southampton?
No.
Oh, God. It's his machine.
Elizabeth,
it's 3:00 in the morning.
He's a goddamn drug dealer.
These are his peak hours.
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I?
This tastes weird.
Harley, it's me.
I need your services.
Translate that
however you want.
I'm at...
- You're at Paul Allen's.
- Who?
Paul Allen.
I want the number, idiot.
Anyway, I'm at Paul Normand's,
and I'll try you again later.
If I don't see you
at Canal Bar tomorrow night,
I'm gonna sic my hairdresser
on you.
Did you know
that guy who disappeared?
Didn't he work at
Pierce & Pierce?
Was he a friend of yours?
No.
Do you have any coke?
Or Halcion?
Oh, I would take a Halcion.
Listen.
I would just like to see
the two of you get it on.
What's wrong with that?
It's totally disease-free.
Patrick, you're a lunatic.
Come on.
Don't you find
Christie attractive?
Let's not get lewd.
I'm in no mood for
a lewd conversation.
Come on.
I think it'd be a turn-on.
Does he do this
all the time?
Christie, you're not
drinking your wine.
You're telling me you've
never gotten it on with a girl?
No. I'm not a lesbian.
Why would you think
I would be into that?
Well, you went to Sarah
Lawrence, for one thing.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys,
Patrick.
You're making me feel weird.
Did you know that
Whitney Houston's debut LP,
called simply
Whitney Houston,
had four number-one singles
on it?
Did you know that, Christie?
You actually listen
to Whitney Houston?
You own a Whitney Houston CD?
More than one?
It's hard to choose a favourite
among so many great tracks,
but The Greatest Love of All
is one of the best, most
powerful songs ever written
about self-preservation,
dignity.
Its universal message
crosses all boundaries
and instils one with the hope
that it's not too late
to better ourselves.
Since, Elizabeth,
it's impossible in this world we
live in to empathize with others,
we can always
empathize with ourselves.
It's an important message.
Crucial, really.
And it's beautifully
stated on the album.
Not the face, you bitch!
Not the fucking face,
you piece of bitch trash!
I want a firm commitment.
I think, Evelyn,
that we've lost touch.
Why? What's wrong?
My need to engage
in homicidal behaviour
on a massive scale
cannot be corrected,
but I have no other way
to fulfill my needs.
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick?
It's over, Evelyn.
It's all over.
Touchy, touchy.
I'm sorry
I brought up the wedding.
Let's just avoid the issue,
all right?
Now, are we having coffee?
I'm fucking serious.
It's fucking over. Us.
This is no joke.
I don't think we should
see each other any more.
But your friends
are my friends,
and my friends
are your friends.
I really don't think
it would work.
You have a little something...
I know that your friends
are my friends,
and I've thought about that.
You can have them.
You're really serious,
aren't you?
Yes, I am.
What about the past?
Our past?
We never really shared one.
- You're inhuman.
- No.
I'm in touch with humanity.
Evelyn, I'm sorry.
I just...
You're not
terribly important to me.
Oh, no!
No! No!
I know my behaviour
can be erratic sometimes.
What do you want me to do?
What is it that you want?
If you really want
to do something for me,
then stop making
this scene right now.
Oh, God, I can't believe
this. I'm leaving.
I've assessed the situation,
and I'm going.
Where are you going?
Just leaving.
But where?
I have to return
some videotapes.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Stop that.
Drop the weapon!
Drop it now!
Get on the ground! Put...
Burning the midnight oil,
Mr Smith?
Hey, now
don't forget to sign in.
Hi.
Harold, it's Bateman.
Patrick Bateman.
You're my lawyer, so I think you should
know, I've killed a lot of people.
Some escort girls
in an apartment uptown.
Some homeless people,
maybe five or ten,
an NYU girl I met
in Central Park,
I left her in a parking lot
behind some doughnut shop.
I killed Bethany, my old
girlfriend, with a nail gun,
and some man...
Some old faggot with a dog.
Last week, I...
I killed another girl
with a chainsaw.
I had to.
She almost got away.
Someone else there.
I can't remember.
Maybe a model.
But she's dead, too.
And Paul Allen.
I killed Paul Allen
with an axe in the face.
His body is dissolving in
a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen.
I don't want
to leave anything out here.
I guess I've killed
maybe 20 people,
maybe 40.
I have tapes
of a lot of it.
Some of the girls
have seen the tapes.
I even...
I ate some of their brains.
And I tried to cook a little.
Tonight, I...
I just had to kill
a lot of people, and...
I'm not sure I'm gonna
get away with it this time.
So, I mean...
I guess
I'm a pretty...
I mean, I guess
I'm a pretty sick guy.
So,
if you get back tomorrow,
I may show up at Harry's Bar.
So, you know.
Keep your eyes open.
Are you my 2:00?
No.
Can I help you?
I'm looking
for Paul Allen's place.
Doesn't he live here?
No, he doesn't.
You sure?
You saw the ad in the Times?
No. Yeah. I mean, yeah.
In the Times.
There was no ad
in the Times.
I think you should go now.
But I think...
I want to know
what happened here.
Don't make any trouble,
please.
I suggest you go.
Don't come back.
I won't.
Don't worry.
Patrick Bateman's office.
Jean? I need help.
Patrick, is that you?
Jean, I'm not...
Craig McDermott called.
He wants to meet you,
David Van Patten, and Tim
Bryce at Harry's for drinks.
Oh, God.
What did you say,
you dumb bitch?
Patrick, I can't hear you.
What am I doing?
Where are you, Patrick?
What's wrong?
I don't think
I'm gonna make it, Jean,
to the office this afternoon.
Why?
Just say no!
What is it, Patrick?
Are you all right?
Stop sounding so fucking sad!
Jesus!
Table for three.
Bateman,
you look a little wild-eyed.
Rough day at the office?
Look, Bryce is back, and
he's drinking mineral water.
He's a changed man,
except he still can't get a
reservation to save his life.
Why don't you
just try 150 Wooster?
I'm not going anywhere
unless we have a reservation.
Le Cirque,
Flamingo East, Oyster Bar.
Come on, faggots,
let's get a res.
Keep your shirt on.
Maybe lose the suspenders.
Need a reservation for 8:30.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Right back.
10:00 would not be any good, no.
Just fucking call them.
- Give me the phone. I'll do it.
- I'll call you back.
Face it. The Japanese will own most
of this country by the end of the '90s.
Ha! Shut up, Carnes.
They will not.
So, Harold,
did you get my message?
Jesus, yes!
That was hilarious.
That was you, wasn't it?
Yeah, naturally.
Bateman killing Allen and the
escort girls. That's fabulous.
That's rich.
What exactly do you mean?
The message you left.
By the way,
Davis, how's Cynthia?
You're still
seeing her, right?
Wait, Harold.
What do you mean?
Excuse me. Nothing.
It's good to see you.
Is that Edward Towers?
Wait.
Davis.
I'm not one to
bad-mouth anyone.
Your joke was amusing,
but come on, man.
You had one fatal flaw.
Bateman is such a dork.
Such a boring,
spineless lightweight.
Now if you said
Bryce or McDermott...
Otherwise, it was amusing.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I really must be going.
Wait.
Stop.
I did it, Carnes.
I killed him.
I'm Patrick Bateman.
I chopped Allen's
fucking head off.
The whole message I left
on your machine was true.
Excuse me.
I really must be going now.
No, listen.
Don't you know who I am?
I'm not Davis.
I'm Patrick Bateman.
We talk on the phone
all the time.
Don't you recognize me?
You're my lawyer.
Now, Carnes,
listen.
Listen very, very carefully.
I killed Paul Allen,
and I liked it.
I can't make myself
any clearer.
But that's simply
not possible.
And I don't find
this funny any more.
It never was supposed to be.
Why isn't it possible?
It's just not.
Why not, you stupid bastard?
Because I had dinner
with Paul Allen
twice in London,
just 10 days ago.
No, you...
Didn't.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
We've seen
the results of that mistrust
in the form of lies,
divisions, and mistakes.
We need to find
a way to cooperate
while realizing foreign policy
can't be run by committee.
And I believe there's now
the growing sense
that we can accomplish more
by cooperating.
And, in the end, this may be
the eventual blessing in disguise
to come out of
the Iran-Contra mess.
How can he lie like that?
- How can he pull that shit?
- What shit?
Now where do we have
reservations at?
I mean I'm not really hungry, but I'd
like to have reservations someplace.
How can you be so fucking...
I don't know...
Cool about it?
Some guys are just born cool,
I guess.
Bateman?
What are you
so fucking zany about?
I'm just a happy camper.
Rockin' and a-rollin'!
Oh, brother! Look. He presents
himself as this harmless old codger,
but inside...
But inside...
But inside doesn't matter.
Inside? Yes?
Inside? Believe it or not,
Bryce, we're actually
listening to you.
Come on, Bateman,
what do you think?
Whatever.
Whose moronic idea was it
to order dry beers?
I need a scotch.
When I named him
to the U.S. Court of Appeals,
the American Bar
Association...
There are no more
barriers to cross.
All I have in common
with the uncontrollable
and the insane,
the vicious and the evil,
all the mayhem I have caused and
my utter indifference toward it,
I have now surpassed.
My pain is constant and sharp,
and I do not hope
for a better world for anyone.
In fact, I want my pain
to be inflicted on others.
I want no one to escape.
But even after admitting this,
there is no catharsis.
My punishment continues
to elude me,
and I gain
no deeper knowledge of myself.
No new knowledge can be
extracted from my telling.
This confession
has meant nothing.
