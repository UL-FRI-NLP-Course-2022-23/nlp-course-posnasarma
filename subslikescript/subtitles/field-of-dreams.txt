RAY: My father's name was
John Kinsella.
It's an Irish name.
He was born
in North Dakota in 1896
and never saw a big city until he
came back from France in 1918.
He settled in Chicago, where
he quickly learned to live and die
with the White Sox.
Died a little when they
lost the 1919 World Series,
died a lot the following summer, when eight members
of the team were accused of throwing that Series.
He played in the minors for a year
or two, but nothing came of it.
Moved to Brooklyn in '35,
married Mom in '38,
was already an old man
at the naval yards
when I was born in 1952.
My name's Ray Kinsella.
Mom died when I was three, and I
suppose Dad did the best he could.
Instead of Mother Goose, I was put
to bed to stories of Babe Ruth,
Lou Gehrig, and the great
Shoeless Joe Jackson.
Dad was a Yankees fan then,
so I rooted for Brooklyn.
But in '58, the Dodgers moved away, so we
had to find other reasons to fight about.
We did.
And when it came time to go to college,
I picked the farthest one
from home I could find.
This drove him up the wall,
which, I suppose, was the point.
Officially, my major was English,
but really, it was the '60s.
I marched, I smoked some grass,
I tried to like sitar music,
and I met Annie.
The only thing we had in common
was that she came from Iowa,
and I'd once heard of Iowa.
After graduation,
we moved to the Midwest
and stayed with her family
as long as we could,
almost a full afternoon.
Annie and I got married
in June of '74.
Dad died that fall.
A few years later,
Karin was born.
She smelled weird,
but we loved her anyway.
Then Annie got the crazy idea
she could talk me
into buying a farm.
So, I love my family,
I love baseball,
and I'm about to become
a farmer.
Until I heard the voice,
I'd never done a crazy thing
in my whole life.
MALE VOICE If you build it,
he will come.
If you build it, he will come.
Hey, Annie!
And what was that?
What was what?
That voice just now.
What was it?
We didn't hear anything.
Uh... uh!
MALE VOICE: If you build it,
he will come.
Okay, you must have heard that!
Sorry. Hey,
come on in to dinner.
Let's go, pumpkin.
Is there, like,
a sound truck on the highway?
Nope. Hey, Karin,
dinner's ready!
Kids with a radio?
Nope.
Hey, are you really
hearing voices?
Just one.
What did it say?
"lf you build it,
he will come."
If you build what,
who will come?
He didn't say.
I hate it when that happens.
Me, too.
MALE VOICE: If you build it,
he will come.
Build what? What is this?
Ray?
It's okay, honey. I...
I'm just talking
to the cornfield.
Anyway, I was walking down
along the street,
and I heard this voice saying,
"Good evening, Mr. Dowd."
Well, I turned around,
and here was this big,
six-foot rabbit leaning
up against the lamppost.
Why did you do that?
It was funny.
Trust me, Karin.
It's not funny.
The man is sick. Very sick.
Karin, honey, now that you're finished
get your book bag. Let's go!
Hon, I'll take her today.
I've got errands to do in town.
Far out.
Hey. What if the voice calls
while you're gone?
Take a message.
ANNIE: (CHUCKLlNG) Bye.
Bye.
In all those years,
did you ever...
It's just I've heard
that sometimes farmers
in the field...
They hear things.
You know, voices.
You hearing voices?
No. It's just I heard
some farmers do.
I of course, don't,
so I was wondering if I was
doing something wrong.
Did you... Did you ever hear
voices out there?
Who's hearing voices?
Ray is.
Out in the fields.
No, I'm not.
I'm...
(CRAZY PLAYING ON STEREO)
(RAY LAUGHING)
Noises. That darned tractor...
I'm just going to get
some 3-in-1 oil.
That ought to do it.
It was nice...
Nice talking to you.
MALE VOICE: If you build it,
he will come.
All right, that's it!
Huh? Who the...
Who are you, huh?
What do you want from me?
Son of a...
MALE VOICE: If you build it,
he will come.
If you build it...
If you build it,
he will come.
ANNIE: You don't suppose
this is like
an acid flashback, do you?
I never took acid.
Maybe you will someday.
It's like a flash-forward.
Annie, there's more.
Honey, why don't you eat
a little bit?
I... I think I know what
"lf you build it,
he will come" means.
Why do I not think
this is such a good thing?
I think it means
that if I build
a baseball field out there,
Shoeless Joe Jackson
will get to come back
and play ball again.
You're kidding?
Uh-uh.
ANNIE: Wow.
Yeah.
You're kidding.
Boy, I thought my family
was crazy, but this is
the craziest thing ever.
I know. It's totally nuts.
I mean, Shoeless Joe!
He's dead. Died in '51.
He's dead.
They suspended him, right?
Right.
He's still dead?
As far as I know.
RAY: Did you know
Babe Ruth copied his swing?
If I did, I've forgotten it.
He was supposed to be
so graceful and agile.
I'd actually like
to see him play again,
to let him play,
to right an old wrong.
Wait. Wait a minute, Bosco.
Are you actually thinking
of doing this?
No.
I mean, I can't think of
one good reason
why I should, but...
I'm 36. I have a wife,
a child, and a mortgage,
and I'm scared to death
I'm turning into my father.
What's your father got
to do with all of this?
I never forgave him
for getting old.
By the time he was as old
as I am now, he was ancient.
I mean, he must have
had dreams, but he never did
anything about them.
For all I know, he may have
even heard voices, too,
but he sure didn't listen
to them.
The man never did
one spontaneous thing
in all the years I knew him.
Annie, I'm afraid
of that happening to me,
and something tells me
this may be my last chance
to do something about it.
I want to build that field.
Do you think I'm crazy?
Yes.
But I also think
if you really feel
you should do this,
then you should do it.
What the hell is he doing?
He's plowing under his corn.
Why?
Ty Cobb called him
the greatest left fielder
of all time.
He said his glove
was the place
where triples go to die.
KARlN: Could he hit?
RAY: Could he hit?
Lifetime average, 356,
third highest in history.
KARlN: Why'd they call him
Shoeless Joe?
RAY: When he was still
in the minors,
he bought a new pair of spikes
and hurt his feet.
In the sixth inning,
he took them off
and played in his socks.
The players kidded him,
called him "Shoeless Joe,"
and the name stuck.
MAN: He's going
to lose his farm.
WOMAN: Damned fool.
RAY: Then in 1919, his team,
the Chicago White Sox,
they threw the World Series.
KARlN: What's "threw"?
RAY: It means
they lost on purpose.
Gamblers paid them to.
Except Shoeless Joe.
He did take their money,
but nobody ever proved
he did one thing
to lose those games.
I mean if he's supposed to be throwing,
how do you explain he hit 375
for the Series and didn't commit
one error?
I can't.
Twelve hits including
the Series' only home run,
and they said
he's trying to lose?
It's ridiculous.
RAY: The commissioner
of baseball suspended eight
of the players,
including the great
Shoeless Joe Jackson,
for life.
KARlN: What's "suspend"?
RAY: It means they never
let him play the game again.
My father said
he saw him years later
playing under a made-up name
in some 10th-rate league
in Carolina.
He'd put on 50 pounds,
and his spring was gone
from his step
but he could still hit.
Dad used to say
nobody could hit
like Shoeless Joe.
I think that's the first time
I've ever seen you smile
when you mentioned your father.
Well...
I have just created something
totally illogical.
That's what I like about it.
Am I completely nuts?
Not completely.
It's a good baseball field, Ray.
It's kind of pretty, isn't it?
Mmm-hmm.
Any sign?
Something's going to happen
out there.
I can feel it.
ANNCUNCER ON TV: So,
for the veteran southpaw,
his summer of woes continues.
That's four straight hits
in the inning.
Daddy, what's a "southpaw"?
It means
a left-handed pitcher, honey.
So how bad is it?
Well, considering how much
less acreage we have for corn,
I say we'll probably
almost break even.
We used up all our savings
on that field, Ray.
Daddy?
Just a minute, Karin.
So what are you saying?
We can't keep the field?
Makes it real hard
to keep the farm.
Daddy.
In a minute, Karin!
There's a man out there
on your lawn.
I'll put on some coffee.
Why don't you go on outside?
Sorry.
I'll get some out there.
Hi.
Ray Kinsella.
Joe Jackson.
I bet it's good
to be playing again, huh?
Getting thrown out of baseball
was like having
part of me amputated.
I've heard that old men wake up
and scratch itchy legs
that have been dust
for over 50 years.
That was me.
I'd wake up at night
with the smell of the ballpark
in my nose,
with the cool of the grass
on my feet,
the thrill of the grass.
Can you pitch?
Yeah,
not bad.
Don't we need a catcher?
Not if you get it
near the plate we don't.
Right.
I'm pitching
to Shoeless Joe Jackson.
Nice hit.
See if you can hit my curve.
You can hit the curve ball.
Put one right here, huh?
Right.
Right, you're a low ball hitter.
Man, I did love this game.
I'd have played for food money.
It was the game,
the sounds, the smells.
Did you ever hold a ball
or a glove to your face?
Yeah.
I used to love traveling
on the trains
from town to town.
The hotels,
brass spittoons in the lobbies,
brass beds in the rooms.
It was the crowd,
rising to their feet
when the ball was hit deep.
Shoot,
I'd have played for nothing.
It's my family.
What's with the lights?
Oh, all the stadiums
have them now.
Even Wrigley Field.
It's harder to see the ball.
The owners found that more
people can attend night games.
Owners.
Mr. Jackson, this is my wife
Annie and my daughter Karin.
Ma'am. Hi.
Are you a ghost?
Karin.
She's kidding.
That's okay.
What do you think?
You look real to me.
Then I guess I'm real.
Would you like to come inside?
Thanks. I don't think I can.
Can I come back again?
Yeah. I built this for you.
There are others, you know.
There were eight of us. It would
really mean a lot to them.
Yeah, anytime.
They're all welcome here.
Hey, is this heaven?
No.
It's Iowa.
Where's he going?
I don't know.
We're keeping this field.
You bet your ass we are.
You're going to lose
your farm, pal.
How can you lose
something so big?
He misplaced the house once.
Yeah, but it turned up.
Ray, come on. Ray? Ray?
This stupid baseball field's going to
bankrupt you, and everybody knows it.
All I'm saying is that If you wait till you default
on your loan, you're going to lose everything.
If you sell right now, my partners will give
you a fair price. You can walk away with it.
Thanks, Mark.
Thanks, Mark, but no.
No.
Alright, let me ask you this - what
are you holding onto this place for?
I mean you never liked Iowa.
That's not true. Come on..
You never liked farming. It is true. You
don't know the first thing about farming.
I know a lot about farming. Oh you do!
I know a lot more than you think I know.
Well, then how could you plow
under your major crop?
What's a crop? (Annie laughing)
ANNIE: Come on. That is funny.
What's a crop?
Daddy, the baseball game is on.
Excuse us.
Annie, I don't believe this guy.
I'm trying to bail him out, and
he leaves to watch television.
He used to be normal.
Yeah.
(LAUGHING)
Buck!
ALL: Whoa!
MAN: All right.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
All right! Home base!
Watch Joe's feet.
A good left fielder
knows what pitch is coming.
He can tell from the bat's angle
which way the ball's heading.
(ALL CHEERING)
Show off!
Stick it in your ear, Gandhi.
If you'd have run like that against
Detroit, I'd have won 20 games!
For Pete's sakes, Cicotte,
that was 68 years ago.
Give it up!
Hey! You guys want
to play ball or what?
Muscle-bound jerk.
At least I got muscles.
At most you got muscles.
Come on, asshole! Pitch!
Weaver, be nice.
Sorry, kid!
It's okay. I don't mind.
ALL: All right, Karin.
Hey, hey, hey!
Ray? Honey, Mom
and everybody's leaving now.
Okay.
Oh, well, it was... You know.
Thanks for coming.
Ray, think about what I said.
I'm just trying to help.
I know.
Thought you two were watching
some game.
It's not really a game.
It's more like practice.
There's only eight of them.
They can't play a real game.
Eight of what?
Them.
Who them?
Them them.
RAY: You don't see them?
Karin, honey,
what are you watching?
The baseball men.
MARK: Baseball men?
Do you see
the baseball men right now?
Of course I do.
What, you really don't see them?
It's not very polite to try to
make other people feel stupid.
Mom, wait a minute.
Mom! Wait a minute.
Dee. Dee, wait.
You don't see these people?
It's not funny, Annie.
They couldn't see it.
This is really interesting.
Hey, Ray, look at this.
Sixty-eight years since I wore this
uniform, still fits me like a glove.
You must keep
in pretty good shape.
Now let's see, I died in '70.
That means I haven't had
a cigarette in what? 18 years.
You don't smoke, do you?
No.
Karin! Ray! Dinner!
"Ray, dinner."
"Dinner, Ray." (laughter)
All right, all right.
Come on.
Let's hit the showers.
Talk you later.
See you, guys.
I'm melting! I'm melting!
MAN: Come on, you knucklehead.
That is so cool.
MALE VOICE: Ease his pain.
What?
I'm sorry. What?
I didn't understand. What?
MALE VOICE: Ease his pain.
Ease his pain. What...
What the hell does that mean,
ease his pain?
What pain? All right.
Whose pain?
Thanks a lot.
Come on, honey, wash up. We got
the PTA meeting after dinner.
Talking about banning books
again, really subversive books,
like The Wizard of Oz,
Diary of Anne Frank.
What happened to you?
The voice is back.
You don't have to build
a football field, do you?
He said, "Ease his pain."
Ease whose pain?
I asked him. He wouldn't say.
Shoeless Joe's?
I don't think so.
One of the other players?
I don't think so.
This is a very nonspecific voice out
there, and he's starting to piss me off.
I was having a fun day today,
a good day.
Want a fry?
And I say,
smut and filth like this has
no place in our schools.
Fascist.
I'd like to ease her pain.
Mrs. Kessinik, Mrs. Kessinik.
That book you're waving about
is hardly smut.
It's considered by many critics to be
the classic novel about the 1960s.
It's pornography!
No, no. The Supreme Court says
it's not.
And it's author, Mr. Mann...
ls sick!
Terence Mann is
a Pulitzer Prize winner.
He's widely regarded as the
finest satirist of his time.
He's a pervert!
Probably a Communist, too!
What planet are
these people from?
Mr. Harris, the so-called
novels of Terence Mann
endorse promiscuity,
godlessness,
the mongrelization of the races,
and disrespect to high-ranking
officers of the United States Army.
And that's why right-thinking school
boards all across the country
having been banning
this man's S-H-l-T
since 1969
Terence Mann?
You know why he stopped writing books.
Because he masturbates.
Excuse me, madam.
Excuse me.
Terence Mann was a warm,
gentle voice of reason
during a time of great madness.
He coined the phrase,
"Make love, not war."
While other people were
chanting, "Burn, baby, burn,"
he was talking about love
and peace and understanding.
I cherished every one or his books, and
I dearly wish he had written some more.
Maybe if you had experienced
even a little bit of the '60s,
you might feel
the same way, too.
I experienced the '60s.
No, you had two '50s and moved
right on into the '70s.
Annie, look at this.
Your husband plowed under his
corn and built a baseball field.
Now, there's
an intelligent response.
The weirdo.
Annie... Honey, it's all right.
I'll be cool.
At least he is not
a book burner, you Nazi cow.
At least I'm not married to the biggest
horse's ass in three counties.
All right, Beulah,
do you want to step outside?
Fine!
RAY: Annie.
All right, honey.
I've got a better idea.
Let's take a vote.
Who's for Eva Braun here?
Who wants to burn books?
Who wants to spit on
the Constitution of the United
States of America? Anybody?
All right. Now,
who's for the Bill of Rights?
Who thinks freedom
is a pretty darn good thing?
Come on! Come on!
Let's see those hands!
Who thinks
we have to stand up
to the kind of censorship
they had under Stalin?
All right. There you go.
America, I love you.
I'm proud of you.
Let's go.
We got to go.
This is great!
RAY: I figured it out.
I figured it out.
(WHOOPlING)
Was that great, or what?
I figured it out.
It's just like the '60s again!
I just figured it out.
"Step outside, you Nazi cow."
I know whose pain
I'm supposed to ease.
What?
I know whose pain
I'm supposed to ease.
I just halted the spread
of neo-fascism in America...
Terence Mann.
What about him? His pain.
That's whose pain.
How do you know that?
Well, I just know. I was right about building
the field, wasn't I? Yeah.
Well, what's his pain?
I don't know.
How are you supposed
to ease it?
I don't know.
Ray.
Well, Ann...
Look, he's my favorite writer,
too,
What has Terence Mann got to do with baseball?
Annie, it's incredible.
By the early '70s,
Mann decides people
have become either
too extremist
or too apathetic to listen to him.
So he stops writing books,
he starts writing poetry
about whales and stuff
and then he starts fooling
around with a home computer.
Know what he does now?
He writes software
for interactive
children's videos.
They teach kids
how to resolve
their conflicts peacefully.
God, what an amazing guy.
What's that got to do
with baseball?
In the April 1962 issue
of Jet Magazine,
there's a story called
"This ls Not A Kite."
It's not his best work,
but the story's hero
is named John Kinsella,
my father.
Wow.
What do you mean, "Wow"?
Big wow! What's it got to do
with baseball?
You drive.
Okay, the last interview
he ever gave was in 1973.
Guess what it's about.
Some kind of team sport.
Mann was a baseball fanatic.
Listen to this.
My earliest recurring dream
was to play at Ebbets Field
with Jackie Robinson
and the Brooklyn Dodgers.
Of course, it never happened.
The Dodgers left Brooklyn.
and they tore down Ebbets Field,
but even now I still dream that dream.
That's sad.
RAY: The man wrote the best
books of his generation.
He was a pioneer
in the civil rights
and the antiwar movement.
I mean, he made
the cover of Newsweek.
He knew everybody.
He did everything.
He helped shape his time.
The guy hung out
with the Beatles.
It wasn't enough.
What he missed was baseball.
Oh, my God!
What?
"As a small boy,
he had a bat named Rosebud."
Give me that.
Sorry.
The guy hasn't been
to a baseball game since 1958.
So, in order to ease his pain,
you're supposed to take him
to a ballgame.
Yes.
Ray, this is nuttier
than building
the baseball field.
No. No, it's not.
It's pretty weird, I'll grant you,
but building the field was
5, 10% weirder.
Sorry, pal, I'm going to have
to nip this one in the bud.
We're having moderate-to-heavy
financial difficulties here.
And you can't take off
for Boston while we're
going broke in Iowa. Honey, this is really...
This is really
new territory for us,I know,
but we're dealing
with primal forces of nature here
When the primal forces of nature tell you to do something,
the prudent thing is not to quibble over details.
Yeah, but why do you
have to go? Why can't
the voice send somebody else?
How about Shirley MacLaine?
Is she too busy?
What does this have
to do with you?
RAY: That's what I have
to find out.
Ray, we are behind
on the mortgage. That field
ate up all of our savings.
We could lose this farm.
I won't even stay in motels.
I'll sleep in the car.
I'll beg for food.
No. No! Now, this is too much!
Now, look. I understand
your need to prove to yourself
and to the world
you are not turning
into your father,
but you've done it.
You believed in the magic.
It happened.
isn't that enough?
It's more than that.
I know this is totally nuts,
but there's another reason
I'm supposed to do it.
I feel it as strongly
as I've felt anything.
There's a reason.
What? Just tell me what it is.
Something's going to happen
at the game. I don't know what..
There's something
at Fenway Park.
I got to be there
with Terence Mann
to find it out.
Is Fenway the one
with the big green wall
in left field?
Yeah.
I dreamt last night
you were at Fenway
with Terence Mann.
Was I sitting
on the first base side?
Yes.
About halfway up on the aisle? Yeah, you were keeping...
Yeah, eating a hot dog.
Eating a hot dog?
I had the same dream.
I'll help you pack.
RAY: Hi, I'm...
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.
Hi. No.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.
It's a great pleasure
to finally get to...
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.
I'm a big fan of yours.
Hi.
How do you do, Mr. Mann?
I have to take you to a base...
All right, stupid,
put your hands up
and get in the trunk.
Good Good.
He lives right around here.
Do you know him?
He's sort of a tall black man.
I'm a friend of his.
If he was much of a friend,
he could give you
the directions himself.
That's a good point.
Thank you.
I don't know where he lives.
Get away from me!
I ain't going
to tell you nothing.
Go away! You're a pest!
Two blocks down,
right-hand side.
First door
that don't have a chicken
in the window is his.
No chicken.
Who the hell are you?
Sir, my name's Ray Kinsella.
We got
a learning disability here?
Mr Mann, if I could just have
one minute, please.
Look, I can't tell you
the secret of life,
and I don't have
any answers for you.
I don't give interviews,
and I'm no longer
a public figure.
I just want to be left alone,
so piss off.
Wait! Wait!
Look, I've come 1, 500 miles
to see you
at the risk of losing my home
and alienating my wife.
All I'm asking is one minute.
Please.
One minute.
Okay, I understand
your desire for privacy,
and I wouldn't dream
of intruding if this weren't
extremely important.
Oh, God.
I don't do causes anymore.
This isn't a cause.
I don't need money
or an endorsement.
Refreshing.
You once wrote,
There comes a time
when all the cosmic tumblers
have clicked into place
and the universe
opens itself up
for a few seconds
to show you what's possible."
Oh, my God!
What?
You're from the '60s.
Well, yeah Actually...
Out!
Hey!
Back to the '60s.
No place for you
here in the future.
Get back while you still can!
You've changed, you know that?
Yes, I suppose I have.
How about this?
Peace, love, dope.
Now get the hell out of here!
You've really pissed me off.
Hold it. Right there.
I was hoping I wouldn't have
to do it this way.
What the hell is that?
It's a gun. What do you think iit is?
It's your finger.
It's not, it's a gun.
Yeah? Let me see it.
I'm not going to show you
my gun.
Look. I'm not going to hurt you.
I just need you to come with me for a little...
What are you doing?
I'll beat you with a crowbar
until you go away.
Whoa! Wait! You can't do that.
There are rules here? Oh, no.
There are no rules here.
You're a pacifist!
Shit.
Thank you Thank you.
So what? You kidnapping me?
What's the deal here?
I was...
I was hoping I could just
convince you to come with me.
So you are kidnapping me?
I have to take you
to a baseball game.
You what?
Tonight's game Red Sox, A's.
Why?
Something will happen there.
I don't know what,
but we'll find out
when it does.
My name's Ray Kinsella.
You used my father's name
for a character
in one of your stories.
John Kinsella.
You're seeing a whole team
of psychiatrists, aren't you?
I don't blame you
for thinking that,
but, no, I'm not.
I swear to God,
I'm the least crazy person
I've ever known.
Why are you kidnapping me
to a baseball game?
May I...
Oh, please.
Want a cup of coffee?
No.
Want some cookies?
No.
I read an interview you gave
a long time ago
about how you always dreamed
of playing at Ebbets Field
and how sad you felt
when they tore it down.
I never said that.
You didn't?
I don't even recall
thinking that.
This is so weird.
This whole...
This whole thing is so weird.
Then why go through with it?
It's a long story.
But it's a really good story.
I'll tell you on the way.
I'm not going to get rid
of you, am I? No..
Just come to this game with me, and I swear to God
I'll never bother you again, not even...
not even a Christmas card.

So what do you do
with yourself these days?
I live, I work.
I learned how to cook.
I take walks and watch sunsets.
Are you staying involved?
I was the East Coast
distributor of involved.
I ate it and drank it
and breathed it.
Then they killed
Martin and Bobby,
they elected Tricky Dick twice,
and now people like you think
I must be miserable
because I'm not involved
anymore.
I've got news for you.
I spent all my misery years ago.
I have no more pain left
for any of you.
I gave at the office.
So what do you want?
I want them to stop
looking to me for answers,
begging me to speak again,
write again, be a leader.
I want them to start thinking
for themselves.
I want my privacy.
No, I meant what do you want?
Oh.
Dog and a beer.
Two.
10 bucks.
Okay, I understand.
You should be entitled to
as much privacy as you want,
but why stop writing?
I haven't published a word
in 17 years,
and still I have to endure
lunatics like you.
What do you think would happen
if I suddenly came out
with a new book?
They'd bleed me dry.
MALE VOICE: Go the distance
Go the distance
What's the matter?
You didn't see that?
See what?
I'm sorry. I guess
you didn't have to be here.
What?
Whenever you want to go,
we can go.
Fine. Let's go.
What is it
you're not telling me?
I've already taken up
too much of your time.
I wish I had your passion, Ray.
Misdirected though
it might be,
it is still a passion.
I used to feel that way
about things, but...
You got another message,
didn't you?
You'll think I'm crazy.
I already think you're crazy.
What did it say?
It said,
"The man's done enough.
Leave him alone."
"Moonlight" Graham.
You saw it.
Saw what?
You saw it.
New York Giants, 1922.
He played one game.
He never got to bat.
What did I see?
Chisholm, Minnesota.
We were the only ones
who saw it.
Did you hear the voice, too?
It's what told me to find you.
Did you hear it?
"Go the distance"?
Yes.
Do you know what it means?
Yes.
What?
It means we're going
to Minnesota to find
"Moonlight" Graham.
We're going... We?
I must be out of my mind.
What do we do when we find him?
How the hell am I supposed to know that?
That's right.
You're right. You're right.
This is so bitching.
I don't believe I'm doing this.
RAY: Hey, Annie, guess what?
I'm with Terence Mann.
ANNIE: Oh, my God.
You kidnapped him.
No, I didn't. He wanted to.
Sorry, but I'm going
to be a few days longer.
We're going to Minnesota.
ANNIE: I don't believe this.
What's in Minnesota?
An old ballplayer.
I'll explain when I get home.
How are things with you?
ANNIE: Fine
Great. Look, Ann,
I got to go, okay?
Give Karin a hug for me,
and I love you.
I love you, too.
Hey, someday explain all this
to me, okay?
