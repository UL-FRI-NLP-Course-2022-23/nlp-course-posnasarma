1880 Yell County, Arkansas. With revenge etched on her mind after the murder of her father by a once-trusted, cowardly jackal, plucky Mattie Ross rides to Fort Smith. Now, nothing else matters, and while aching to bring his killer to justice, Mattie enlists the help of the ageing U.S. Marshal Reuben "Rooster" J. Cogburn: a rugged, one-eyed lawman. And, before long, La Boeuf, a young Texas Ranger thirsty for bounty money, joins in. However, as the unlikely trio embarks on a dangerous journey into the heart of Indian Territory, the odds are against them. But, only rabid vengeance keeps determined Mattie going. Is true grit enough to see justice served?
