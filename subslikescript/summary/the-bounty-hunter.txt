An ex-cop turned bounty hunter shows up in a small town looking for a man who's jumped bail. However, the real reason he's there is to avenge his old friend, an Indian who lived in the area and was murdered by the local sheriff, who is trying to get the Indians to sell their land cheaply so an oil company can move in and take over the land, which they believe sits on top of large reserves of oil.
