After many years apart, Emilie (26) meets her brother Jakob (22) again. She not only shares her sadness about the loss of their parents with him, but also a secret... It is Emilie's wish to arrange the sale of their jointly inherited holiday house in the Swiss Alps. Unlike her brother, a professional skateboarder, she needs the money as a young entrepreneur. The family business, which she took over with her boyfriend Andreas (29), is heavily indebted. Emilie consciously retains a certain distance toward her brother, having successfully repressed her emotions toward him for many years. But his direct and unashamedly upfront behaviour gradually starts to undermine her cool fa√ßade. The vast and pristine alpine landscape affords the two an unaccustomed degree of freedom. The more Emilie suppresses reality, the more Jakob insists on a decision about their joint future. Emilie's rationally-conducted relationship to Andreas and her deep affection for Jakob inevitably come into conflict. Can the two siblings really live a love that must remain invisible?
